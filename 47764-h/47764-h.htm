<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In preparing this little book, three things have
been kept constantly in mind&mdash;the plan of the
whole series, the thought and sentiment expressed
in each lesson, and the language used to express
the thought.</p>

<p>The main feature of the plan is to furnish pupils
interesting historical stories for the purpose
of giving them a taste for the study of history, to
enable them to distinguish between fact and fiction,
and to stimulate them to high endeavor by noble
example.</p>

<p>In selecting, preparing, and arranging the stories,
care has been taken that the thought is such
as to be readily understood, and that on the whole
it tends to awaken the higher emotions. The
moral lesson involved should be absorbed rather
than learned, and the teacher should beware of
destroying the value of any lesson by dealing out
moral pap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The language is that of common life, such as
the pupil hears every day from parent, friend, and
teacher&mdash;such as the morning newspaper brings,
and such as is necessary for him to master in its
printed and written forms in the shortest possible
time. When a word is unknown, the teacher
should develop its meaning before permitting the
lesson to go on. The interest in the story will be
a sufficient stimulus to secure the best of attention,
and the highest excellence in delivery.</p>

<p>In the use of language, it is far better that
pupils should be obliged to stretch upward rather
than be remanded to the nursery. Baby-talk
should no more be revived than long-clothes, and
the time spent in writing stories in words of one
syllable might be used to a much better purpose.</p>

<p>The history of the Do-as-you-likes speaks for
itself. It is a fancy story rather than a myth, but
it is one that children will like, long before they
will understand its whole significance; and we
much doubt whether the Rev. Charles Kingsley
ever produced a more valuable and original book
than "Water-Babies," from which this story is
taken.</p>

<h2>MYTHS.</h2>


<h3><a id="LATONA"></a>I.&mdash;LATONA AND THE RUSTICS.</h3>


<p>1. Once on a time the goddess Latona wandered
into the country with her infant twins in
her arms. Weary with her burden and parched
with thirst, she espied in the bottom of the valley
a pond of clear water, where the country people
were at work gathering willows and osiers. The
goddess approached, and, kneeling on the banks,
would have slaked her thirst in the cool water
but the rustics forbade her.</p>

<p>2. "Why do you refuse me water?" said she;
"water is free to all. Nature allows no one to
claim as property the sunshine, the air, and the
water; I come to take my share of the common
blessing. Yet I ask it of you as a favor. I only
desire to quench my thirst. My mouth is so dry
that I can hardly speak. A draught of water
would revive me, and I would own myself indebted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to you for life itself. Let these infants
move your pity, who stretch out their little arms
as if to plead for me."</p>

<p>3. Who would not have been moved with the
gentle words of the goddess? But these clowns
would not desist; they even added jeers and
threats of violence if she did not leave the place.
Nor was this all; they waded into the pond, and
stirred up the mud with their feet, so as to make
it unfit to drink.</p>

<p>4. Latona was so angry that she lifted up her
voice to Heaven and cried out, "May they never
quit that pool, but pass their lives there!" And
so it came to pass. They now live in the water,
sometimes below and sometimes with their heads
above the surface. Sometimes they come out on
the bank, but soon leap again into the water. They
still use their bass voices in railing, and, though
they have the water all to themselves, they still
croak about it. Their voices are harsh, their throats
bloated, their mouths have stretched, their necks
have disappeared, and their heads are joined directly
to their bodies. Their backs are green,
their huge bellies white, and they leap instead of
walking. Have you seen anything like them?</p>

<h3><a id="PAN"></a>II.&mdash;THE MUSIC OF PAN.</h3>

<p>1. Pan, the earth-god, had great skill in music,
and he performed upon his pipes in a wonderful
way. Everybody praised him, and he grew so
vain that he thought no one could equal him, and
he sent a challenge to Apollo, the god of the lyre,
to a trial of skill. The challenge was accepted,
and Imolus, the mountain-god, was chosen umpire.
Imolus cleared away the trees from his ears,
to listen. At a given signal, Pan blew his pipes,
and his rustic melody greatly pleased himself and
his followers.</p>

<p>2. Then Imolus turned his head toward the
sun-god, and all the trees turned with him. Apollo
rose: in his left hand he held the lyre, and
with his right hand struck the strings. The music
was truly heavenly, and Imolus at once awarded
the victory to the god of the lyre. All agreed
with him except old King Midas, who happened
to be present. He questioned the decision of the
umpire, and declared that Pan's music was the
best. Apollo would not permit such a depraved
pair of ears any longer to wear the human form,
but caused them to grow out long, and to become
hairy within and without, and movable at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
roots. So the old king, as long as he lived, wore
the ears of a donkey.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="BAUCIS"></a>III.&mdash;BAUCIS AND PHILEMON.</h3>

<p>1. On a certain hill in Phrygia stand a linden-tree
and an oak. Not far from the spot are a marsh,
and a lake which was once the site of a thriving
village. Once on a time, Jupiter, in human shape,
and Mercury, without his wings, paid a visit to
this country, and, after a weary day's walk, they
reached the village about nightfall. Here they
applied for shelter in vain. Everywhere they
were driven away with insults, and even, in some
places, the dogs were set upon them. At last they
reached the outskirts of the village, where stood
a humble thatched cottage. Here Baucis, a pious
old dame, and her husband Philemon, united when
young, had grown old together.</p>

<p>2. One need not look here for master or for
servant; they two were the whole household, master
and servant alike. Here the two travelers
found rest. As they crossed the humble threshold,
and bowed their heads to pass under the low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
door, the old man placed a seat, and Baucis set
about preparing them some food. She raked out
the coals, kindled up the fire with dry sticks, and
with her scanty breath blew it into a flame. Her
husband gathered pot-herbs from the garden, and
cut a slice of bacon from the flitch in the chimney,
which Baucis quickly prepared for the pot. She
then filled a beechen bowl with clean water for her
guests to wash, keeping up a pleasant talk all the
time.</p>

<p>3. On the bench where her guests were to sit
she placed a cushion filled with sea-weed, and then
set out the table. This she rubbed down with
sweet-smelling herbs, and placed upon it some
olives, radishes, and cheese, and eggs lightly cooked
in the ashes. All was served in coarse earthen
dishes. When all was ready, the stew, smoking
hot, was placed upon the table. Some wine was
added; and, for dessert, apples and wild-honey;
and, over and above all, friendly faces and simple
and hearty welcome.</p>

<p>4. The guests sat down, and the old couple saw
with astonishment that, as fast as it was poured
out, the wine renewed itself, and they then knew
that they were entertaining superior beings. They
begged pardon for the coarseness of their fare, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Jove raised them to their feet, thanked them for
their kindness, and then said: "We are gods.
The people of the village must pay the penalty
for their indolence and cruelty. Come with us to
the top of yonder hill." They hastened to obey,
and, with staff in hand, labored up the steep ascent.
At the top they turned their eyes below, and they
saw the whole village turned into a lake, and their
house the only one remaining.</p>

<p>5. But, while they gazed with wonder at the
sight, their old cottage changed into a temple. Lofty
columns took the place of the corner-posts, the
thatch was changed to a gilded roof, the floors became
marble, and the doors were hung with ornaments
of gold. Then Jupiter spoke and said:
"Excellent old people, what favors have you to
ask of us?" Then Baucis and Philemon took
counsel together, and answered, "Let us finish
our lives here, where we have lived so long, and
we wish to pass from life together in the same
hour."</p>

<p>6. The prayer was granted. For many years
they were the keepers of the temple, and when
they were very old, as they stood before the steps
of the sacred edifice, they felt themselves stiffen
so they could not stir. At the same moment a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
leafy crown grew over the heads of each, and they
had scarcely time to say, "Good-by, dear Philemon,"
"Good-by, dear Baucis," when they were changed
into two stately trees&mdash;he into a sturdy oak, and
she into a graceful linden. There they stand, side
by side, to the present day, and when the wind
rises the peasant can hear the rustle of the leaves
as the branches caress each other, which seems to
say, "Dear Baucis!" "Dear Philemon!"</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="DRAGON"></a>IV.&mdash;THE DRAGON'S TEETH.</h3>

<p>1. For many years Cadmus traveled in search
of his lost sister Europa, who was carried off by
Jupiter in the disguise of a white bull. As he
was unsuccessful, he dare not return to his own
country, but consulted the oracle to know where
he should settle. He was told to follow a cow,
and where she lay down he should found a city
and call it Thebes. As he came out of the cave
where the oracle dwelt, he saw the cow and followed
her. After several hours' weary tramp she
lay down on a broad plain, and Cadmus saw that
here he must build his city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>2. He gave thanks, and, wishing to offer a sacrifice
to Jupiter, he sent his servants to bring pure
water for a libation from a grove near by. In the
cave by the fountain lurked a horrid serpent with
a crested head, and scales glittering like gold. His
eyes shone like fire, and he had a triple tongue
and triple rows of teeth. No sooner had the servants
dipped their vessels in the water, than out
rushed the serpent with a fearful hiss and killed
them all with his fangs and poisonous breath.</p>

<p>3. Cadmus waited until midday for their return,
and then went in search of them. He wore
a lion's hide, and besides his javelin he carried a
lance. When he entered the wood and saw the
dead bodies of his men, and the monster with his
bloody jaws, he exclaimed, "O faithful friends,
I will avenge you or share your death!" So saying,
he lifted a huge stone and threw it at the serpent,
but it made no impression on the monster.
Cadmus next threw his javelin, and this penetrated
the serpent's scales. Fierce with pain, the monster
broke off the handle of the weapon but left the
iron point still in the flesh. His neck swelled
with rage, bloody foam covered his jaws, and the
breath of his nostrils poisoned the air around.
Now he threw himself forward upon Cadmus, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the hero retreated backward holding his spear before
the monster's open jaws. At last Cadmus
made a sudden thrust with the spear and pinned
the serpent's head to a tree. Then how the monster
did writhe, and hiss, and spit out his venom!
but the spear held fast, and he soon died.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/illus017.jpg" width="397" height="600" alt="Cadmus wearing a lion's hide and carrying a lance" />
</div>

<p>4. Then Cadmus heard a voice telling him to
take out the dragon's teeth and sow them in the
ground. So he made a furrow in the ground, and
into it he sowed the teeth and covered them up.
Scarce had he done so, when the clods began to
move, and the points of spears appeared above the
ground. Next helmets, with their nodding plumes,
came up, and next the shoulders and breasts and
limbs of men. Soon a crop of warriors stood before
him, all armed for fight. Their looks became
fierce and cruel as they stood and glared at one
another. Cadmus was afraid of his life, but one of
them said, "Meddle not with our civil war." At
length one of the warriors raised his sword and
smote down another. Then commenced a fight,
and soon all of them were killed but five. These
cast away their weapons and said, "Let us live in
peace." They joined Cadmus, and helped him
build his city of Thebes.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="DO_AS"></a>V.&mdash;THE DO-AS-YOU-LIKES.</h3>

<p>1. The fairy brought out from her cupboard a
big book, and Tom and little Ellie read in the
title-page, "The History of the Great and Famous
Nation of the Do-as-you-likes, who came away from
the Country of Hardwork, because they wanted to
play on the Jew's-harp all day long."</p>

<p>2. In the first picture they saw these Do-as-you-likes
living in the land of Ready-made, at
the foot of the Happy-go-lucky Mountains, where
flap-doodle grows wild; and if you want to
know what that is, you must read "Peter Simple."</p>

<p>3. Instead of houses, they lived in the beautiful
caves of tufa, and bathed in the warm springs
three times a day; and, as for clothes, it was so
warm there that the gentlemen walked about in
little besides a cocked hat and a pair of straps, or
some light summer tackle of that kind; and the
ladies all gathered gossamer in autumn to make
their winter dresses.</p>

<p>4. They were very fond of music, but it was
too much trouble to learn to play the piano or
violin; so they sat on ant-hills all day long and
played on the Jew's-harp; and if the ants bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
them, why they just got up and went to the next
ant-hill, till they were bitten there also.</p>

<p>5. And they sat under the flapdoodle-trees,
and let the flapdoodle drop into their mouths;
and under the vines, and squeezed the grape-juice
down their throats; and if any little pigs ran
about ready roasted, crying "Come, and eat me,"
as was the fashion in that country, they waited
till the pigs ran against their mouths, and then
took a bite, and were content, just as so many oysters
would have been.</p>

<p>6. They needed no weapons, for no enemies
ever came near their land; and the stern old fairy
Necessity never came near them to hunt them up,
and make them use their wits or die. And so on,
till there were never such comfortable, easy-going,
happy-go-lucky people in the world.</p>

<p>7. "Well, that is a jolly life," said Tom. "You
think so?" said the fairy. "Do you see that great
peaked mountain there behind, with smoke coming
out of its top?" "Yes." "And do you see those
ashes, and slag, and cinders lying about?" "Yes."
"Then turn over the next five hundred years, and
you will see what happens."</p>

<p>8. And behold! the mountain had blown up like
a barrel of gunpowder, and then boiled over like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a kettle; whereby one third of the Do-as-you-likes
were blown into the air, and another third were
smothered in the ashes; so that there were only
one third left. "You see," said the fairy, "what
comes of living on a burning mountain."</p>

<p>9. "Oh, why did you not warn them?" said
little Ellie. "I did warn them all I could. I let
the smoke come out of the mountain, and wherever
there is smoke there is a fire. And laid the ashes
and cinders all about; and wherever there are cinders,
cinders may be again. But they did not like
to face facts, my dears, as few people do; and so
they invented a cock-and-bull story, which, I am
sure, I never told them, that the smoke was the
breath of a giant, whom some god or other had
buried under the mountain; and other nonsense
of that kind. And when folks are in that humor
I can not teach them, save by the good old birch-rod."</p>

<p>10. And then she turned over the next five
hundred years; and there were the remnant of
the Do-as-you-likes, doing as they liked, as before.
They were too lazy to move away from the mountain;
so they said, "If it has blown up once, that
is all the more reason it will not blow up again."
And they were few in number, but they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said, "The more the merrier, but the fewer the
better fare."</p>

<p>11. However, that was not quite true; for all
the flapdoodle-trees were killed by the volcano,
and they had eaten all the roast pigs, who, of
course, could not be expected to have little ones;
so they had to live very hard, on nuts and roots
which they scratched out of the ground. Some
of them talked of sowing corn, as their ancestors
used to do, before they came into the land of
Ready-made, but they had forgotten how to make
plows, and had eaten all the seed-corn which they
had brought out of the land of Hardwork years
since; and of course it was too much trouble to
go away and find more. So they lived miserably
on roots and nuts, and all the weakly little children
had great stomachs, and then died.</p>

<p>12. "Why," said Tom, "they are growing no
better than savages." "And look how ugly they
are all getting!" said Ellie. "Yes; when people
live on poor vegetables, instead of roast beef and
plum-pudding, their jaws grow larger and their
lips grow coarser, like the poor people who eat
nothing but potatoes."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="people on top of trees and lions" />
</div>

<p>13. And she turned over the next five hundred
years, and there they were all living up in trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and making nests to keep off the rain. And underneath
the trees lions were prowling about.
"Why," said Ellie, "the lions seem to have eaten
a good many of them, for there are very few left
now!" "Yes," said the fairy, "you see it was only
the strongest and most active ones who could climb
the trees, and so escape." "But what great, hulking,
broad-shouldered chaps they are!" said Tom;
"they are as rough a lot as ever I saw."</p>

<p>14. And she turned over the next five hundred
years. And in that they were fewer still, and
stronger, and fiercer; but their feet had changed
shape very oddly, for they laid hold of the branches
with their great-toes, as if they had been thumbs,
just as a Hindoo tailor uses his toes to thread his
needle.</p>

<p>15. The children were very much surprised,
and asked the fairy whether that was her doing.
"Yes and no," she said, smiling. "It was only
those who could use their feet as well as their
hands who could get a good living; so they got
the best of everything, and starved out all the
rest." "But there is a hairy one among them,"
said Ellie. "Ah!" said the fairy, "that will be
a great man in his time, and chief of all the tribe."</p>

<p>16. And when she turned over the next five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hundred years, it was true. For this hairy chief
had hairier children still. The climate was growing
so damp that none but the hairy ones could
live; all the rest coughed and sneezed, and had
sore throats, and went into consumptions, before
they could grow up into men and women.</p>

<p>17. Then the fairy turned over the next five
hundred years. And they were fewer still. "Why,
there is one on the ground picking up roots," said
Ellie, "and he can not walk upright." No more
he could; for, in the same way that the shape of
their feet had altered, the shape of their backs
had altered too. "Why," said Tom, "I declare
they are all apes!"</p>

<p>18. "Something fearfully like it, poor, foolish
creatures," said the fairy. "They are grown so
stupid now, that they can hardly think; for none
of them have used their wits for many hundred
years. They have almost forgotten, too, how to
talk. For each stupid child forgot some of the
words it heard from its stupid parents, and had
not wit enough to make fresh words for itself.
Besides, they have grown so fierce and suspicious
and brutal, that they keep out of each other's way,
and mope and sulk in dark forests, never hearing
each other's voice, till they have forgotten almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
what speech is like. I am afraid they will all be
apes very soon, and all be doing only what they
liked."</p>

<p>19. And in the next five hundred years they
were all dead and gone, by bad food and wild
beasts and hunters; all except one tremendous old
fellow with jaws like a jack, who stood full seven
feet high; and M. du Chaillu came up to him and
shot him, as he stood roaring and thumping his
breast. And he remembered that his ancestors
had once been men, and he tried to say, "Am I
not a man and a brother?" but he had forgotten
how to use his tongue; and then he had tried to
call for a doctor, but he had forgotten the word
for one. So all he said was "Ubboboo!" and
died. And that was the end of the great and
jolly nation of the Do-as-you-likes.</p>

<h2>INDIAN STORIES.</h2>

<h3><a id="COLUMBUS"></a>VI.&mdash;COLUMBUS AND THE ECLIPSE.</h3>


<p>1. When Columbus first landed upon the
shores of the New World, and for a long time
after, the natives thought that he had come down
from heaven, and they were ready to do anything
for this new friend. But, at one place, where he
stayed for some months, the chiefs became jealous
of him and tried to drive him away. It had been
their custom to bring food for him and his companions
every morning; but now the amount they
brought was very small, and Columbus saw that
he would soon be starved unless he could make a
change.</p>

<p>2. Now, Columbus knew that in a few days
there was to be an eclipse of the sun; so he called
the chiefs around him and told them that the
Great Spirit was angry with them for not doing
as they agreed in bringing him provisions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that, to show his anger, on such a day, he would
cause the sun to be darkened. The Indians listened,
but they did not believe Columbus, and
there was a still greater falling off in the amount
of the food sent in.</p>

<p>3. On the morning of the day set, the sun rose
clear and bright, and the Indians shook their heads,
as they thought how Columbus had tried to deceive
them. Hour after hour passed, and still the
sun was bright; and the Spaniards began to fear
that the Indians would attack them soon, as they
seemed fully convinced that Columbus had deceived
them. But at length a black shadow
began to steal over the face of the sun. Little
by little the light faded, and darkness spread over
the land.</p>

<p>4. The Indians saw that Columbus had told
them the truth. They saw that they had offended
the Great Spirit, and that he had sent a dreadful
monster to swallow the sun. They could see the
jaws of this horrible monster slowly closing to
shut off their light forever. Frantic with fear,
they filled the air with cries and shrieks. Some
fell prostrate before Columbus and entreated his
help; some rushed off and soon returned laden
with every kind of provisions they could lay their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hands on. Columbus then retired to his tent, and
promised to save them if possible. About the
time for the eclipse to pass away, he came out and
told them that the Great Spirit had pardoned
them this time, and he would soon drive away the
monster from the sun; but they must never offend
in that way again.</p>

<p>5. The Indians promised, and waited. As the
sun began to come out from the shadow, their
fears subsided, and, when it shone clear once more,
their joy knew no bounds. They leaped, they
danced, and they sang. They thought Columbus
was a god, and, while he remained on the island,
the Spaniards had all the provisions they needed.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="PEQUOTS"></a>VII.&mdash;THE PEQUOTS.</h3>

<p>1. Early in 1621 the Pilgrims who settled at
Plymouth, Massachusetts, made a treaty with Massasoit,
the chief of the Wampanoags, who inhabited
the eastern part of the State. This treaty was
observed by all the Indian tribes in the vicinity
for a long time, and it was not until three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
after the first settlers arrived in Connecticut that
an Indian war broke out.</p>

<p>2. The Pequots were a small but very warlike
tribe, living upon Long Island Sound, near
the border of Rhode Island. These Indians attacked
the settlers, and in 1627 they killed three
men at Saybrook, and six men and three women
at Wethersfield.</p>

<p>3. These things caused great alarm, and a
council was called at Hartford to consider what
was to be done. A force, consisting of ninety
white men and seventy friendly Indians, under
the command of Captain Mason, were sent against
them.</p>

<p>4. They went down the Connecticut River
from Hartford to Saybrook in boats, and thence
eastward along the Sound to the Indian fort
Mystic, near where Stonington now stands. They
reached the spot about daybreak. The Pequots
had no suspicion that an enemy was near. But
as they reached the fort a dog barked, and the
Indian sentinel called out, "Owanux! Owanux!"
(Englishmen! Englishmen!), and the savages
sprang to arms. The soldiers fired and killed
many Indians, but it was a fight of the little army
of whites against six hundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The Indians fought bravely, and Captain
Mason, fearful of being defeated, called out, "We
must burn them!" A torch was applied to a
wigwam, and soon the whole fort was in flames.
Seventy wigwams were burned, and six hundred
men, women, and children perished.</p>

<p>6. A few Indians escaped, and, joining others
of their tribe, took refuge in a swamp in Fairfield.
Here the whites pursued them, and killed and
captured nearly the whole tribe. The prisoners
and all that remained alive of the Pequots, were
divided and given to the Mohicans and the Narragansetts,
two tribes friendly to the English.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="SCHEN"></a>VIII.&mdash;SCHENECTADY.</h3>

<p>1. In the winter of 1690 a small party of
French and Indians made a raid upon Albany.
They concluded to destroy Schenectady first.
The people of Schenectady had been warned of
their danger, but they would not believe that
men would come from Canada, a distance of two
or three hundred miles, through the deep snows of
winter, to molest them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But they were fatally deceived. A strong
stockade, of more than a mile in length, was built
around the houses which composed the village.
This stockade had a gateway at each end, and
these gateways were usually carefully guarded at
night. But, believing themselves safe, the watchman
became careless and went to sleep. The
enemy arrived on Saturday night, and succeeded
in getting within the stockade without giving any
alarm. They divided themselves into small parties,
so that every house might be attacked at the
same instant. They entered the place about
eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>3. The inhabitants were all asleep, and stillness
rested upon the place. With a noiseless step
the enemy distributed themselves through the village,
and, at a given signal, the savage war-whoop
was sounded. What a dreadful cry was this to the
startled fathers and mothers of this unhappy town!</p>

<p>4. It is scarcely possible to describe the scene
that followed. The people, conscious of their danger,
sprang from their beds, but were met at the
door and slaughtered by the savages; and the
Indians, rendered frantic by the wild scene, ran
through the place, slaying those they chanced to
meet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Sixty of the people were killed, and twenty-five
were made prisoners. Some attempted to escape,
but as they were in their night-clothes, and
the night was very cold, only a part of them
reached Albany, sixteen miles distant, the nearest
point of refuge, and of these, twenty-five lost
limbs by the cold. As the alarm was given, the
Indians returned to Canada without an attack
upon Albany.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="DUSTIN"></a>IX.&mdash;THE STORY OF MRS. DUSTIN.</h3>

<p>1. In the winter of 1696 a party of Indians
made an attack upon the town of Haverhill,
Massachusetts. Among the people of that town
was a Mr. Dustin. He was in a field at work,
when the news of the attack reached his ears. He
immediately started and ran to his house to save
his family. He had seven children, and these he
collected for the purpose of taking them to a place
of safety before the Indians should arrive.</p>

<p>2. His wife was ill, and she had an infant but
a week old. He now hurried to her, but, before
she could get ready to leave the house, Mr. Dustin
saw that a party of savages were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
close by. Expecting that all would be slain, he
ran to the door and mounted his horse, with the
intention of taking one of his children&mdash;the one
that he loved best&mdash;and flying with it to a place
of safety.</p>

<p>3. But which should he take? Which of his
seven children should he leave to the savages?
He could not decide, and therefore, telling the
children to run forward, he placed himself between
them and the Indians. The Indians fired
at him, but they did not hit him. He had a gun,
too, and he fired back at them.</p>

<p>4. Then he hurried his little children along,
loading his gun as he went, and firing at his pursuers.
Thus he proceeded for more than a mile&mdash;protecting
his little family, defending himself, and
keeping the enemy at a distance. At length, he
reached a place of safety, where the children were
beyond the reach of the Indians. His feelings
were divided between joy for the escape, and grief
for the poor wife left behind.</p>

<p>5. But Mrs. Dustin was destined to undergo
the severest trials. Although she was very ill,
the savages compelled her, with the nurse and her
little infant, to go with them. They soon left the
town of Haverhill, and set out to go to the homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the Indians. These were at a distance of one
hundred and fifty miles. It was winter, and the
journey was to be taken on foot through the wilderness.</p>

<p>6. Mrs. Dustin and the nurse were soon overcome
with fatigue. The Indians, seeing that the
little infant occupied much of their attention,
snatched it from its mother, and killed the little
innocent by striking it against a tree. After a
toilsome march, and the greatest suffering, Mrs.
Dustin and her companion completed the journey.</p>

<p>7. But now the Indians were to remove to a
distant place, and these two women were forced
to accompany them. When they reached the end
of their journey, they found out that they were
to be tortured. They then resolved to make their
escape.</p>

<p>8. One night Mrs. Dustin, the nurse, and
another woman rose secretly while the Indians
were asleep. There were ten of them in the
wigwam where they were. These the women
killed with their own hands and then departed.
After wandering a long time in the woods, they
reached Haverhill, and Mrs. Dustin was restored
to her family.</p>

<h3><a id="SLIDE"></a>X.&mdash;ROGERS'S SLIDE.</h3>

<p>1. Major Rogers, a brave patriot, commanded
a corps of rangers in the winter of 1758. He was
stationed on Lake George. One day he started
with a few men to spy out the position of his Indian
foes.</p>

<p>2. A band of Indians surprised the party, and
put them to flight. Major Rogers, by the aid of
his snow-shoes, was able to gain the summit of a
hill overlooking the lake. At this point the lake
is narrow, and the rocks are piled up in huge
masses. One crag rises to the height of about four
hundred feet, with an almost perpendicular surface,
sloping down to the lake below.</p>

<p>3. The major knew that the Indians would
follow rapidly on his track. When he reached
the brow of the cliff he quickly cast off his knapsack
and haversack, and sent them sliding down
the icy path. He then took off his snow-shoes,
and, without moving them, turned himself about
and put them on his feet again. He retreated
along the brow of the hill for several rods, and
down a ravine he made his way to the lake, found
his pack, and fled on the ice to Fort George.</p>

<div class="caption">Rogers's Slide, Lake George</div>
</div>


<p>4. The Indians arrived at the spot, saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
two tracks, and supposed that two people had cast
themselves off the rock rather than be captured.
Just then they saw the bold ranger making his
way across the ice, and believed that he had safely
slid down the steep face of the rock. They
thought that the pale-face must be protected by
the Great Spirit, and made no attempt at pursuit.
The rock has ever since been known as Rogers's
Slide.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="MARCH"></a>XI.&mdash;GENERAL CLINTON'S MARCH.</h3>

<p>1. In the War of the Revolution, the Indians
belonging to the Six Nations, living in Central and
Western New York, mostly joined the British.
For several years parties of Tories and Indians,
every little while, would attack the frontier settlements
and murder the settlers. In 1778 General
Sullivan was sent into the country around Seneca
Lake to break up the hostile force, and, if
possible, to drive the Indians out of the country.
A part of this force, under the American General
Clinton, started from the Mohawk Valley to join
Sullivan in Southern New York.</p>

<p>2. The march was through an unbroken wilderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
As there were no roads, their provisions
were loaded into boats and floated up the small
streams, and there the freight, boats, and all, were
carried by the men to the head-waters of another
stream. They had little trouble until they reached
Otsego Lake, and from this point they expected
less, as the outlet of the lake formed the Susquehanna
River, and on this river, far below, they
expected to join Sullivan. But the weather was
hot, and for many weeks there had been no rain.
The river had not water enough to float the boats,
and for a time Clinton thought he would be
obliged to turn back.</p>

<p>3. But at last he hit upon a scheme that promised
success. He built a dam across the river just
where it flows out of the lake. His soldiers rolled
in great bowlders from the fields, and filled the
spaces between with brush and clay. The water
could not flow out freely, and the lake began to
rise. In three weeks it was six feet above its
summer level. The boats were then made ready,
with the provisions and men on board, and the
dam was torn down. The waters flooded the
banks of the narrow stream, and the whole party
were carried down to the place of meeting with
Sullivan in safety.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="epubonly">
        <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/illus040b.jpg" width="599" height="470" alt="" />
</div>

</div>

<p>4. The Indians along the stream saw this sudden
rise of waters, and they were much frightened.
No rain had fallen, and the only way they could
account for it was that the Great Spirit had sent
the waters to help the white men, and they everywhere
fled in the greatest alarm. General Clinton
did not meet one armed enemy until he joined
Sullivan, and the combined army met no opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
until they reached the spot where Elmira
now stands. Here a battle took place, in which
the Indians were defeated. Upon the return of
Sullivan from his successful raid into the Indian
country, he was obliged to kill his horses for want
of forage, and the place where the horses' skulls
lay for a long time has since been called Horseheads.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="FRANCES"></a>XII.&mdash;FRANCES SLOCUM.</h3>

<p>1. In 1778 the Tories and Indians made an
attack upon the little settlement of Wyoming, on
the Susquehanna River, in Pennsylvania. The
fort was captured, and nearly all the prisoners&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;were murdered in
cold blood. Every house was burned, and the
few people who escaped into the woods, went
through terrible trials before they reached a place
of safety. Most of the savages had bloody
scalps hung to their belts, to show that they had
taken part in the battle and the murder that followed.</p>

<p>2. Near the scene of the Wyoming battle lived
a Quaker, named Slocum, who had been a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
friend of the Indians. For a time no one troubled
him; but early one morning some Indians came
down, scalped a boy, named Kingsley, and carried
away Frances, Mrs. Slocum's little daughter, five
years old. Soon after, Mr. Slocum was also murdered.
The mother stayed in the valley, hoping
to hear of her lost child. When peace came, two
brothers of the lost one went to Canada in search
of her, but all their inquiries were in vain, and
they gave her up as dead.</p>

<p>3. But the mother still hoped on. She was
certain that Frances was still alive. Other captives
were found, but the mother went down to
her grave without any tidings of the child that
had been so cruelly taken from her. The brothers
became aged men, and little Frances was almost
forgotten.</p>

<p>4. In 1837, fifty-nine years after her capture,
an Indian agent and trader gave an account of a
white woman living with the Indians near Logansport,
Indiana. Joseph Slocum and a sister
at once set out for Ohio, where they met their
younger brother, Isaac. The three then went on
to Logansport, where they learned that the white
woman lived about twelve miles distant. She
was sent for, and the next morning she came riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
into town upon a spirited young horse, and
accompanied by her two daughters. She could
not speak English, and an interpreter was found.
She listened to what her brothers had to say, but
did not answer. At sunset she started for her
home, but promised to be back in the morning.</p>

<p>5. She came, true to her promise. The mother
had told Joseph years before of one sure test.
When they were little children Joseph, then a
child two and a half years old, while playing with
a hammer gave Frances a blow upon the middle
finger of the left hand, which crushed the bone
and deprived the finger of the nail. When Joseph
told this incident the aged woman was greatly
agitated, and, while tears streamed down her face,
she held out the wounded finger. There was no
longer a doubt. The love for her kindred which
had slept for more than fifty years was aroused,
and she eagerly inquired after her father, mother,
brothers, and sisters.</p>

<p>6. Her full heart was opened, and she freely
gave the story of her life. She said the savages
took her to a cave in the mountains the first night.
She was kindly treated, and was tenderly carried in
their arms when she was weary. She was adopted
by an Indian family, and brought up as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
daughter. For years she had led a roving life,
and she liked it. She was taught the use of the
bow, and soon learned all the arts of the Indian
household. When she grew up, her Indian parents
died, and she soon afterward married a young
chief of the nation.</p>

<p>7. She was treated with more respect than Indian
women generally are; and she was so happy
in her life that the greatest evil she feared was
that she should be obliged to go back to the
whites, whom she regarded as the Indians' worst
enemies. Her husband was dead, and she had
been a widow many years. Children and grandchildren
were around her, and life was passing
pleasantly away. When she finished her story,
she lifted her right hand in a solemn manner and
said, "All this is as true as that there is a Great
Spirit in the heavens!"</p>

<p>8. The next day her brothers and sister went
out to visit her at her home. She was living in
a well-built log-house, which was surrounded by
cultivated fields. She had a large herd of cattle
and sixty horses. She had saved her share of the
annuity which the Government paid the Indians,
and had about one thousand dollars in specie.
Her white friends stayed with her several days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and had a delightful visit. Afterward Joseph, his
wife, and daughter paid her another visit, and then
bade her a last farewell. She died about 1844,
and was buried with great honors, as she was regarded
as a queen by her tribe.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="PUMPKINS"></a>XIII.&mdash;OBED'S PUMPKINS.</h3>

<p>1. Moving was serious business ninety years
ago, when the Moore family migrated to Ohio, for
everything had to be carried hundreds of miles in
a wagon, and there was no sending back for anything
forgotten. So Obed prudently secured passage
for some pumpkin-seeds, lest a failure of
pumpkin-pies for Thanksgiving might annul that
festival altogether in the unknown wilderness.</p>

<p>2. There was only one room in their new house,
and no regular up-stairs at all&mdash;only a loft where
the boys slept, and to which they had to climb
on a ladder when they went to bed. Ruth and
Dolly slept in the trundle-bed down-stairs.</p>

<p>3. That first winter was a hard one, but nobody
really suffered. Mr. Moore was clearing up his
land, so they had an abundance of fuel; the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
trapped rabbits, and their father's musket kept
them supplied with other game, but Mrs. Moore
had to measure the flour and meal very carefully,
and as for other things, they went without, only
once, when Obed found a squirrel's nest in a hollow
tree, and came in with his pockets full of
nuts.</p>

<p>4. "Little did that rascal know who he was
gathering these for," he remarked, as they cracked
them on the hearth that evening. "Yes, and maybe
it's little you know who you'll raise your pumpkins
for. Injuns, like as not," said Joe.</p>

<p>5. One morning Dolly declared that she had
been wakened in the night by mice in the chimney-cupboard.
"It <em>can't</em> be mice; we're too far from
neighbors," said Mrs. Moore, opening the cupboard.
Joe climbed upon a chair behind her, and there
on the topmost shelf were some nibbled scraps of
cloth and paper.</p>

<p>6. "O Obed!" he exclaimed, in dismay,
"your pumpkin-seeds are all gone!" Just then
there was a rustle, and he caught sight of two
bright, black eyes. They saw him, too, and
another rustle gave him a vanishing glimpse of a
bushy tail. "It's squirrels!" he shouted; "Obed,
they've come to get their pay for the nuts you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
stole." "Oh, dear!" said Obed, "I'd rather have
my pumpkin-seeds than all the nuts that ever grew.
We never shall taste pumpkin-pies again, now."</p>

<p>7. Weeks afterward they were burning out
some stumps in the clearing, when out from a hollow
one popped a squirrel. Obed ran to investigate,
and, poking around and pulling away the rotten
wood, brought to light some rags and bits of
paper. "Hello!" he exclaimed, "the identical chap
that carried off my pumpkin-seeds!" And sure
enough, there were the empty shells, and among
them&mdash;oh, for a vision of the smile that lighted
Obed's freckled face!&mdash;three whole, sound seeds.</p>

<p>8. All their crops did well that first year, and
the way those pumpkin-vines bore was a marvel;
but no abundance could shake Obed's resolve to
reserve the first pumpkin-pies for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>9. On the preceding Monday, Mr. Moore
started for the nearest village to purchase winter
supplies. With many brave assurances and secret
misgivings, his family saw him set out, for the
journey required two days, and the Indians were
growing threatening of late. But when the first
night had worn away in safety, they began to feel
easier, and gave themselves up to the Thanksgiving
preparations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>10. "O Obed!" said Joe, as late in the afternoon
he staggered into the house under a huge
yellow pumpkin, "let's make some jack-lanterns;
'twon't hurt the pumpkins for pies." Obed assented,
and they had just completed those grotesque
horrors, and were going out to do the
chores, when a man galloped up, and everybody
rushed to the door.</p>

<p>11. "Get ready for the redskins!" he shouted,
springing from the saddle, "and give me a fresh
horse. They killed a family down the river last
night, and nobody knows where they'll turn up
next! Husband away? Whew! that's bad!
Well, shut up as tight as you can. Cover up
your fire, and don't strike a light to-night." And,
leaping upon the horse the boys led around, he
flew away to warn the next settler.</p>

<p>12. They made what hasty preparations they
were able, and Mrs. Moore reluctantly yielded to
Obed's urgent plea that she would keep the
younger children quiet in the loft, while he and
Joe watched below.</p>

<p>13. The two boys crouched beside the hearth
listening to every sound. At last Obed crept to
the window. A snow-flurry had whitened the
ground early in the evening, and, as he peered out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the boy descried shadows moving across the fields.
"They're coming, Joe!" he whispered; "stand by
that window with the axe, while I get the rifle
pointed at this one."</p>

<p>14. Joe noiselessly stationed himself, and Obed
opened the bullet-pouch. As his fingers came in
contact with the leaden balls, his heart chilled.
They were too large for his rifle! They belonged
to the musket, and his father had taken the wrong
pouch. With a last despairing hope he was feeling
in the cupboard for any chance balls that
might have been left behind, when he stumbled
over something that nearly threw him headlong.
It was the forgotten jack-lantern. With a sudden
thought he pulled off his coat and flung it over
the face of the lantern, then searching in the ashes
for a live coal, cautiously lighted the candle within
and closed the opening. With every sense
sharpened to its utmost, he lifted the pumpkin
and went softly toward the window. Ten or
twelve dusky figures were stealthily nearing the
house, and at the same instant he detected a slight
noise at the door.</p>

<p>15. "They'll sound the war-whoop in a minute,
if I give them time," he said to himself. "Now
for it!" And he dropped the coat, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
grinning monster exposed to view. Mrs. Moore,
listening with bated breath in the room above,
just then heard an unearthly yell and fainted
dead away. "Quick, Joe! Light up the other
one!" exclaimed Obed, excitedly, as he saw the
savages flying wildly back to the woods.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus050.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="redskins running scared" />
</div>

<p>16. Joe, with every hair on end, was still standing
valiantly at his post, his uplifted axe ready to
fall on the first head that should risk an entrance.
He had paid no attention to Obed's movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>,
and was momentarily expecting to hear the roar
of the old rifle.</p>

<p>17. "The other jack-lantern! Don't you see
that's what scar't 'em so?" demanded Obed as,
emboldened by his success, he bobbed the hideous
thing up and down before the window. Joe finally
comprehended, and, speedily lighting the second
one, imitated Obed's lively evolutions with such
effect that, when Mrs. Moore came-to, the yells
were dying away in the distance, and she heard
Obed climbing the ladder.</p>

<p>18. The anxious mother now gathered her
family in the room below, and watched patiently
for daylight and her husband. They came together,
and the story had to be told all over again.
"And so," added Joe, "Obed did raise his pumpkins
for the Injuns, after all."</p>

<h2>STORIES OF THE REVOLUTION.</h2>

<h3><a id="GASPE"></a>XIV.&mdash;THE GASPÉ.</h3>


<p>1. Just before the Revolution, the British ship-of-war
Gaspé was sent to Narragansett Bay to
see that the trade was all right there. Lieutenant
Duddington was the commander, and he annoyed
the traders as much as possible. He would order
a vessel to stop, go on board of her, and, having
seen that everything was right, would go off with
words of insult instead of apology. The Governor
of Rhode Island ordered Duddington to let the
trading-vessels alone, but the pert little officer only
laughed at him. Next the Governor appealed to
Admiral Watson, and received an insulting reply.</p>

<p>2. By this time the people were aroused. The
petty little tyrant had issued an order that all vessels
sailing up the bay should lower their flag by
way of salute&mdash;an order very much like that of
Gessler when he required the people to bow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a hat set upon a post. On the 9th of June Captain
Lindsay, coming up in his packet, refused to
lower his flag. The Gaspé gave chase, but Captain
Lindsay dodged about among the shoals in
such a way that the Gaspé got aground on the
sand. Here she must stick until high tide, about
three o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>3. The news soon reached Providence. Mr.
John Brown, one of the leading merchants, saw
that it was a good time to end the troubles. He
fitted out eight of the largest boats he could get,
and placed them under the command of Captain
Whipple, one of his most trusted ship-masters.
The boats left Providence about ten o'clock in the
evening, with sixty-four men, armed with paving-stones.
As they approached the Gaspé, the sentinel
hailed them, and Lieutenant Duddington
fired a pistol at them. The reply was a single
musket-shot, which brought the officer down, badly
wounded. The ship's company were then ordered
ashore, and the ship set on fire. At dawn she
blew up.</p>

<p>4. A large reward was offered by Admiral
Watson for the discovery of the parties engaged
in this affair. Although the boats were publicly
fitted out, and their departure was seen by hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of people, not one jot of information could
he get. Commissioners sent over from England
met with no better success, and after a trial of six
months they gave it up as a bad job. A poem,
written in regard to this affair, concludes with
this verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse i4">5. "Now, for to find these people out,</div>
<div class="verse">King George has offered very stout:</div>
<div class="verse">One thousand pounds to find out one</div>
<div class="verse">That wounded William Duddington;</div>
<div class="verse">One thousand more he says he'll spare</div>
<div class="verse">For those who say the sheriffs were;</div>
<div class="verse">One thousand more there doth remain</div>
<div class="verse">For to find out the leader's name;</div>
<div class="verse">Likewise five hundred pounds per man</div>
<div class="verse">For any one of all the clan.</div>
<div class="verse">But let him try his utmost skill,</div>
<div class="verse">I'm apt to think he never will</div>
<div class="verse">Find out any of those hearts of gold</div>
<div class="verse">Though he should offer fifty-fold."</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="ALLEN"></a>XV.&mdash;ETHAN ALLEN.</h3>

<p>1. During the Revolution, the pride and the
hero of the Green Mountains was Ethan Allen,
and probably there was no man living then that
had more of the elements of the popular hero than
he. He was tall, almost a giant in stature, and
strong in proportion. He was easily excited to
anger, and his rage was something terrific. In another
place it is told how he surprised and captured
the strong fortresses of Ticonderoga and
Crown Point. Afterward he was captured and
taken prisoner to England. The brutal British
officer in command put him in irons, and one day
spat in his face. Allen, beside himself with rage
at this insult, with his teeth wrenched off the
head of the nail which fastened his handcuffs, and
attacked the officer, who was obliged to retreat to
save his life.</p>

<p>2. With all his rough ways and fits of anger
Allen was a remarkably honest man. It is related
of him that he owed a person in Boston sixty
pounds, for which he gave his note. When due,
it was sent to Vermont for collection. Allen could
not pay at the time, and he employed a lawyer to
postpone the payment until he could raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
money. The lawyer arose in court and denied
Allen's signature to the note, as this would oblige
the other party to send to Boston for a witness,
and give Allen all the time he wanted.</p>

<p>3. When the lawyer made his plea, Allen, who
happened to be in the back part of the court-room,
strode forward, and in a voice of thunder addressed
the lawyer: "Mr. Jones, I did not hire you to
come here to lie! This is a true note&mdash;I signed
it&mdash;I'll swear to it&mdash;and I'll pay it! I want no
shuffling, I want time. What I employed you for
was to get this matter put over to the next court,
not to come here and lie and juggle about it."

<h3><a id="REED"></a>XVI.&mdash;JOSEPH REED.</h3>

<p>1. A hero of another kind, and one we should
never forget, is Joseph Reed, of New Jersey. He
entered the patriot army, and proved a brave and
efficient officer. In 1778 he entered Congress, and,
while quiet, he became one of the most useful
members. Soon after he entered Congress, a British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
commission was sent out to see if the difficulties
between the two countries could not be adjusted
and the war terminated. The terms they
offered, however, did not include independence.
Convinced that they could not accomplish their
object directly, the commissioners resorted to deceit
and bribery, and they offered Joseph Reed
ten thousand guineas if he would use his influence
to help along their project. The noble patriot
heard the offer with great indignation, and replied,
"I am not worth purchasing, but, such as I am,
the King of Great Britain is not rich enough to
buy me." The poet Freneau has recorded this incident
in a poem from which the following extract
is made:</p>

<h3><a id="GENERAL"></a>XVII.&mdash;GENERAL PRESCOTT.</h3>

<p>1. In 1777 the British troops upon the Island
of Rhode Island were commanded by General
Prescott. Of all the disreputable officers sent
over by the British during the Revolution, he was
the meanest and the worst. He was cruel at
heart, a petty tyrant, and a real coward. His government
was so offensive to the people of Rhode
Island, that they determined to put an end to it.
The British army was stationed at Newport, and
the British ships sailed up and down Narragansett
Bay to protect the island from any attempted surprise
on the part of the Americans. Feeling perfectly
secure under the protection of the fleet,
General Prescott made his headquarters at the
house of a Mr. Ovington, five miles out of Newport,
and beyond the British military lines.</p>

<p>2. The residence of General Prescott became
known to the patriot leaders at Providence, and
they resolved to make an effort to capture him.
The enterprise was intrusted to Colonel William
Barton, who entered upon the service with zeal
and discretion. On the night of July 10, 1777,
Barton, with a few chosen men, embarked in
four whale-boats, and with muffled oars rowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
across the bay to the island, passing directly
through the fleet of ships and guard-boats. They
came so near the ships that they could hear the
sentinel's cry of "All is well!" After landing
they made their way silently to the Ovington
house, and captured the guard without creating
an alarm.</p>

<p>3. Barton boldly entered the house, and found
Mr. Ovington reading, the rest of the family being
in bed. He inquired for General Prescott's room,
and was told it was directly overhead. Taking
with him four sailors, and Sisson, a powerful negro,
Barton ascended the stairs, and gently tried
the door. It was locked; but there was no time
to be lost: the negro drew back a few paces, and,
using his head for a battering-ram, burst open the
door at the first effort. Prescott begged time to
dress, but, as time was precious, he was hurried
down to the shore without clothes, and placed in
the boat, where he could dress at leisure. The
boats then took their way back in perfect silence,
and about midnight landed upon the mainland
in safety. "Sir, you have made a bold push to-night!"
said Prescott, to his captor. "We have
been fortunate," replied Barton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="BOY"></a>XVIII.&mdash;PRESCOTT AND THE YANKEE BOY.</h3>

<p>1. In the spring of 1778, Prescott was exchanged
for General Charles Lee, and returned to
Rhode Island. Soon afterward the British admiral
invited the general to dine with him and his
officers on board his ship, then lying in front of
Newport. Martial law yet prevailed on the island,
and men and boys were frequently sent by the
authorities on shore to be confined in the ship as
a punishment for slight offenses. There were several
on board at the time.</p>

<p>2. After dinner, the free use of wine made the
company hilarious, and toasts and songs were frequently
called for. A lieutenant remarked to the
admiral, "There is a Yankee lad confined below
who can shame any of us in singing."</p>

<p>3. "Bring him up," said the admiral. "Yes,
bring him up," said Prescott. The boy was
brought to the cabin. He was pale and slender,
and about thirteen years of age. Abashed by the
presence of great officers, with their glittering uniforms,
he timidly approached, when the admiral,
seeing his embarrassment, spoke kindly to him,
and asked him to sing a song.</p>

<p>4. "I can't sing any but Yankee songs," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the trembling boy. "Come, my little fellow, don't
be afraid," said the admiral. "Sing one of your
Yankee songs&mdash;any one you can recollect."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="600" height="470" alt="prescott and the yankee boy" />
</div>

<p>5. The boy still hesitated, when the brutal Prescott,
who was a stranger to the lad, roared out:
"Sing us a song, or I will give you a dozen with
the cat!" But the admiral interfered and told
him to sing, and he should be set at liberty the
next morning. Thus encouraged, the lad sang the
following ballad, composed by a sailor at Newport:</p>

</div>
</div> <!-- poem -->

<p>17. The boy was frequently interrupted by
roars of laughter at Prescott's expense, which
strengthened the child's nerves and voice; and
when he had concluded his song, "I thought,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wrote a gentleman who was present, "the deck
would go through with the stamping." General
Prescott joined heartily in the merriment produced
by the song, and, thrusting his hand into his
pocket, he pulled out a coin, and handed it to the
boy, saying, "Here, you young dog, is a guinea
for you!" The boy was set at liberty the next
morning, and went ashore.</p>

<h3><a id="KEGS"></a>XIX.&mdash;BATTLE OF THE KEGS.</h3>

<p>1. In 1777, while the British occupied Philadelphia,
Washington made an effort to destroy
their shipping. He caused torpedoes to be constructed
in the form of strong kegs, and launched
in the river, hoping that the tide would float them
against the British ships, when they would explode.
But the British discovered them, and
for a time were greatly frightened. Then they
opened upon them a furious cannonade; and for
the next twenty-four hours they fired at everything
that floated in the water. Mr. Hopkinson,
the author of "Hail, Columbia," has given the
following amusing account of this battle:</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="JONES"></a>XX.&mdash;THE DARING OF PAUL JONES</h3>

<p>1. It was in the spring of 1778 that the name
of John Paul Jones became so terrible along the
western coasts of Britain&mdash;his native coasts, as
familiar to him as to a Solway fisherman.</p>

<p>2. And what a tough, valiant, intractable, audacious
hero he was, with his foppish ways and
costume, his romantic, fantastic courtesy and enthusiasm!
He had been a Nelson, if he had had
Nelson's opportunities. He was a little man, too,
like Nelson, though compactly built, and his voice
was "soft and still, and small, and his eye had
keenness and softness in it, and, full as he was of
the spirit of mastery, he was all gentleness, consideration,
generosity, to men who obeyed him."
Like all the greatest fighters, he performed his immortal
exploits while he was young; he was but
thirty-two when he did his greatest day's work.</p>

<p>3. On the southwestern coast of Scotland John
Paul Jones was born. Nothing could keep him
from the sea. At twelve he was apprenticed to a
merchant in the American trade, in whose ships
he served seven years, as cabin-boy, and sailor before
the mast. At the age of twenty-four we find
him settled in Tobago, engaged in commerce, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
possessing considerable property. In 1774 he
came to the colonies. The Revolution breaking
out, he obtained a lieutenant's commission in the
forming navy of the United States. He acquired
sudden and very great distinction. In one short
cruise he took sixteen prizes, of which he burned
eight and sent in eight. He had some sharp actions
with king's ships, and captured one, which
had on board a company of British troops, and
ten thousand suits of clothes&mdash;a most precious acquisition
in 1776.</p>

<p>4. It was Paul Jones who first hoisted the Stars
and Stripes. On the very day, June 14, 1777, on
which Congress resolved that "the flag of the thirteen
United States be thirteen stars, white in a
blue field, representing a new constellation," they
also resolved that "Captain Paul Jones be appointed
to command the ship Ranger." As he
had been the first to hoist the flag of the United
States on a ship-of-war, so, on entering the harbor
of Brest in February, 1778, seven days after the
signing of the treaty of alliance, he was the first
naval officer who had the pleasure of acknowledging
a salute to that flag from a foreign power.</p>

<p>5. Soon after, Captain Jones sailed in the
Ranger for the Scottish coast, on his first cruise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in British waters. On the seventh day he was
between the Isle of Man and Whitehaven waters,
which he knew as familiarly as New-Yorkers
do the Narrows. Whitehaven was the town at
which he had been apprenticed, and from which
he had sailed for ten years. It was a town of several
thousand inhabitants, and its harbor contained
three or four hundred vessels closely moored
together. Jones had formed the daring scheme
of running in near the port, landing two parties,
burning all these ships, and retiring before an
armed force could be raised to repel him.</p>

<p>6. At midnight, with two boats and thirty-one
men, provided with combustibles and dark-lanterns,
he left his ship and made for Whitehaven
pier. Day was dawning when he reached it, for
the light wind had made him hours too late in
starting. He would not abandon the enterprise,
however, unpromising as it seemed. Sending one
boat to the north side of the harbor to fire the
vessels collected there, he went himself to do the
same office to the stranded fleet on the south side.</p>

<p>7. Familiar with every foot of the ground he
had to traverse, he boldly landed under the guns
of the two forts that protected the harbor, and
he himself climbed the wall of one of them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
spiked every gun, without giving alarm. All the
sentinels, he found, had gone to the guard-house,
and there he secured and disarmed every one of
them without giving or receiving a scratch. Then,
accompanied by one man, he scaled the other fort
and spiked its guns. Returning to the pier to begin
the conflagration, he found there the other boat,
which had come back for a light, the candles in
the lanterns having burned out. Jones now discovered
that all his own candles were consumed,
and there was not in either boat a spark of fire, or
the means of kindling one. The day, too, had
dawned, and every second was precious. Nevertheless,
he sent one of his men to a house near by
for a light, who soon returned successful, and the
boats again separated for the work of destruction.</p>

<p>8. Ten minutes later a barrel of fat, ignited
in the steerage of a ship that lay surrounded by a
hundred and fifty others, all left high and dry
by the receded tide, shot a bolt of roaring flame
through the hatchway. The people of the town,
in hundreds, were soon running to the pier. Captain
Jones stood by the side of the burning vessel,
pistol in hand, and ordered the crowd to keep
their distance, which they did. Not till the flames
had caught the rigging and wreathed about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
mainmast, not till the sun was an hour high, not
till the whole town was rushing amazed to the
scene, did Jones give the order to embark.</p>

<p>9. His men entered the boats without opposition,
the captain releasing, at the last moment,
all his prisoners but three, who were all he had
room for. He stood on the pier till his men were
seated in the boats, and for some little time after;
then, stepping gracefully into his place, he gave
the word, the oars splashed into the water, and
they moved toward the ship, while from every
eminence in the vicinity hundreds and thousands
of silent, astonished spectators gazed upon the unearthly
scene.</p>

<p>10. "To the forts!" was the cry on shore, as
soon as the spell of the enemy's presence was removed.
"Their disappointment," says Jones,
"may easily be imagined, when they found at
least thirty heavy cannon, the instruments of their
vengeance, rendered useless! At length, however,
they began to fire, having, as I apprehend, either
brought down ship-guns, or used one or two cannon
which lay on the beach dismounted, and had
not been spiked. They fired with no direction,
and the shot falling short of the boats, instead of
doing us any damage, afforded some diversion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which my people could not help showing, by discharging
their pistols in return for the salute."
The people of the town succeeded in confining the
ravages of the fire to a few ships. Had it been
possible, he remarks, to have landed a few hours
sooner, he could have burned three hundred vessels.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="FORT"></a>XXI-FORT MOULTRIE.</h3>

<p>1. Early in 1776 Governor Rutledge, of South
Carolina, built Fort Moultrie, to protect Charleston
from an attack by sea. The fort was built
of palmetto-wood, which is soft, but very tough
and springy. In the middle of the fort was a low
place scooped out of the earth, designed to hold
water. Before the fort was finished, the British
admiral, Sir Peter Parker, with two large ships-of-war,
made his appearance off the harbor. Colonel
Moultrie commanded within the fort. His
men were all militia, and had never been in battle
before.</p>

<p>2. Sir Peter commenced a furious attack upon
the fort from his principal ships. But the balls
entered the soft palmetto-wood and did no damage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Shells were thrown into the fort, struck in
the interior ditch, which on the day of battle was
filled with mud, instead of water, and the fuses
were put out, or the shells burst and did no other
damage than covering the men with a thick coat
of mud. All day long the ships kept up their
terrible broadsides, and all day long did the brave
militiamen in the fort return the fire slowly but
with good aim. It would not do to waste fire, as
powder was low; and several times during the
battle the gunners were obliged to stop firing until
a new supply of powder came in from the city.</p>

<p>3. In the meantime, the people in the city
were fearful and anxious; that small, half-finished
fort was all that stood between them and
capture. They could hardly believe that Colonel
Moultrie with his raw troops could resist the attack
of a formidable British fleet. All day long
they heard the boom of the cannon, and all day
long the steeples and roofs of houses were crowded
with anxious spectators. With joy, they saw the
ships crawl away toward night, fearfully cut
up, while the fort continued its firing as the
powder came slowly in. Then the bells rang,
and a shout went up, that cheered the hearts of
the brave garrison at the fort. One of the ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
got aground, and was set on fire and burned up.
Only ten of the militia were killed, and twenty-two
wounded, while the loss on the ships numbered
hundreds.</p>

<p>4. One incident of this battle is worthy of
note. During the action, the flag-staff was shot
away, and the flag fell to the earth outside the
fort. Sergeant William Jasper at once jumped
over the parapet, picked up the flag, and, amid the
storm of iron from the fleet, he fastened it to a
staff and set it up once more, and then leaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unhurt into the fort. The next morning Governor
Rutledge publicly thanked Jasper, and gave him a
small sword that hung by his side. Three years
later the gallant sergeant was killed in the attack
upon Savannah.</p>

<h3><a id="COUNT"></a>XXII.&mdash;COUNT PULASKI AND HIS BANNER</h3>

<p>1. Count Casimer Pulaski was a native of
Poland. At an early age he entered the army,
where he soon became a leader of a patriotic movement
to rid Poland at once of an unpopular king
and of Russian rule. His little army was defeated,
and in 1771 he entered the service of the Turks,
then at war with Russia. In 1776 he went to
Paris and had an interview with Dr. Franklin,
and resolved to enter the service of the United
States. He sailed for America the next year, and
was placed by Washington in command of cavalry.
He proved a very valuable acquisition to the
American cause. His familiarity with military
affairs enabled him to bring his corps to a high
degree of efficiency in regard to discipline, and in
battle he was a very thunderbolt. He was stationed
along the New Jersey coast, keeping watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the British during the greater part of 1778;
and the next spring he was ordered south to assist
General Lincoln and the Count d'Estaing in the
reduction of Savannah.</p>

<p>2. This enterprise, planned by Washington
with every prospect of success, met with a series
of mishaps and disasters from the very first. The
troops were tardy in concentrating, enabling the
British commander to complete measures of defense
which at first were very imperfect. Then
there was a want of co-operation between the
American forces and their French allies. When
everything was in readiness, Count d'Estaing
granted the British commander twenty-four hours
truce, which he employed to so good a purpose
that the idea of an assault was abandoned, and
the operations were turned into a siege. For
twelve days there was constant battle, ending in
a general assault. No troops ever fought better,
but they were driven back from the strong fortifications
of the enemy with great loss. The golden
moment was lost, and the great sacrifice of life
was in vain. Count Pulaski was in the van of
the fight during all these anxious days, and was
stricken down at the very last moment, a hero
dying for our freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In 1777 Pulaski visited Lafayette while
that officer was wounded, and under the care of
the Moravian nuns, at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
When it became known that the brave Pole was
raising a company of cavalry, the nuns prepared a
banner of crimson silk, beautifully wrought with
the needle by their own hands, and sent it to
Pulaski with their blessing. This banner he received
with grateful thanks, and took it with him
in every battle to the day of his death. The story
of this banner is beautifully told by Longfellow:</p>

<h3><a id="LYDIA"></a>XXIII.&mdash;LYDIA DARRAH.</h3>

<p>1. While the British were in Philadelphia,
one of Howe's principal officers made his quarters
at the house of a Quaker named William Darrah.
His wife, Lydia, was a true patriot, but she said
so little, and performed her household work so
well, that she won the entire confidence of her
guest. One day he said to her, "I expect some
friends to call this evening, and they will stay late,
so have your family out of the way early." This
order aroused her curiosity, and, when her family
were in bed, she took off her shoes and went into
the passage and listened to what was going on.
She heard one of the officers read an order of Sir
William Howe for the troops to march out the
next night silently, and surprise Washington in
his quarters. She went back to bed, and, when it
was time for her to get up and let out the visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
she was apparently fast asleep. She formed her
plans during the night, and, early in the morning,
she awakened her husband and told him that flour
was wanted for family use, and that she must go
to Frankford to get it.</p>

<p>2. It was a cold morning in December, and a
deep snow covered the ground. On foot, with a
bag in her hand, she set out, calling at Howe's
headquarters for a permit to leave the city. At
an early hour she reached Frankford, and, leaving
her bag at the mill, she went on until she reached
the American outposts. Here she met Colonel
Craig, who had been sent out by Washington to
get what news he could of the enemy. To him
Mrs. Darrah told her story, and then went back
to the mill, shouldered her flour, and hastened
home.</p>

<p>3. From her window, the next night, in the
cold starlight, she watched the British troops as
they marched silently out of town, and a few hours
later she saw them on their way back from their
"fool's errand." The officer came home and bade
Lydia go to his room. With an air of great
secrecy he said, "Were any of your family up on
the night when I had company in my room?"
"No," she replied; "they all retired at eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
o'clock." "It is very strange," said the officer.
"You, I know, was asleep, for I knocked on your
door three times before you heard me. But, by
some means, our plans became known, for, when
we went out, we found Washington ready to receive
us, with his cannon mounted and his troops
under arms, so we were compelled to march back
like a parcel of fools."</p>


<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="BELL"></a>XXIV.&mdash;THE LIBERTY-BELL.</h3>

<p>1. The old State-House at Philadelphia still
stands, and is preserved with the greatest care.
Thousands of people from all parts of the United
States visit it every year, for here Congress met
in 1776, and here the Declaration of Independence
was signed, July 4th. In the State-House is kept
the old Liberty-Bell, which is thought almost as
sacred as the house itself.</p>

<p>2. This bell was bought in England, in 1752,
for the State-House. It was then the largest bell
in America. Upon the first trial-ringing it cracked,
and it hung unused in the steeple for a year. It
was then taken down and recast, with these words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in relief letters around its top: "<cite>Proclaim liberty
throughout the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.</cite>"
In the hall underneath
this very
bell, twelve years
later, Congress did
indeed proclaim liberty,
and the joyful ringing of this bell first told
the crowd of anxious people without that the
Declaration of Independence had been passed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
For two hours the tones of the bell floated down
from above and mingled with the roll of drums,
the booming of cannon, and shouts of the multitudes
below.</p>

<div class="epubonly">
        <div class="figcenter" style="width: 548px;">
        <img src="images/illus083.jpg" width="548" height="600" alt="the liberty-bell" />

        </div>
</div>

<p>3. After more than fifty years of service, the
bell was cracked again, and rendered useless. It
is now kept as a sacred relic of the past. The
following is the last stanza of a poem upon the
old bell by William Ross Wallace:</p>

<div class="poem" style="margin-top: 1em;">
<div class="verse i4">4. "That old bell is still seen by the patriot's eye,</div>
<div class="verse">And he blesses it ever, when journeying by;</div>
<div class="verse">Long years have passed o'er it, and yet every soul</div>
<div class="verse">Will thrill, in the night, to its wonderful roll;</div>
<div class="verse">For it speaks to its belfry when kissed by the blast,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a glory-breathed tone from the mystical past.</div>
<div class="verse">Long years shall roll o'er it, and yet every chime</div>
<div class="verse">Shall unceasingly tell of an era sublime;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, yes! if the flame on our altars should pale,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<div class="verse i2">Let its voice but be heard, and the freeman will start,</div>
<div class="verse">To rekindle the fire, while he sees on the gale</div>
<div class="verse i2">All the stars and the stripes of the flag of his heart."</div>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="TORY"></a>XXV.&mdash;THE TORY'S HORSE.</h3>

<p>1. While Cornwallis was virtually master of
the Carolinas, raids were made in all directions to
prevent the patriots from assembling, and to break
up the bands of Sumter and Marion, which had
proved to be very annoying to the British commander.
The most noted commander of these
raids was Colonel Tarleton, who displayed great
activity in plundering and burning the homes of
the patriots. Some of the planters were Tories,
and eagerly welcomed the British troops.</p>

<p>2. While Tarleton was out on one of his raids,
Macdonald, a young Scotchman, one of Marion's
men, played a curious trick on an old Tory, who
lived in the neighborhood. As soon as he heard
that Colonel Tarleton had encamped, he dressed
himself in the British uniform, and early in the
morning called upon the Tory, and said to him:</p>

<p>3. "Colonel Tarleton sends his compliments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and, knowing you to be a good friend of the king,
begs you will send him one of your best horses
for a charger, to help drive the rebels out of the
country."</p>

<p>4. "Send him one of my finest horses!" cried
the old Tory, his eyes sparkling with joy. "Yes,
Mr. Sergeant, that I will. A good friend of the
king did he call me? Yes, God save his sacred
majesty, a good friend I am, indeed, and true!
And faith I am glad, too, that the colonel knows
it. Here, Dick, run, jump, fly, you rascal, to the
stable, and bring me out Selim. Young Selim!
Do you hear?"</p>

<p>5. Then, turning to Macdonald, he went on:
"Well, Mr. Sergeant, you have made me confounded
glad this morning, you may depend!
And now, suppose you take a glass of peach&mdash;of
good old peach, Mr. Sergeant? Do you think it
would do you any harm?" "Why, they say it is
good on a rainy morning, sir," replied Macdonald.
"Oh, yes, famous of a rainy morning, Mr. Sergeant&mdash;a
mighty <em>antifogmatic</em>. It prevents the ague,
Mr. Sergeant, and clears the throat of the cob
webs, sir."</p>

<p>6. "Your honor's health!" said Macdonald,
as he turned off a bumper of the strong cordial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
But scarcely had he smacked his lips, before Dick
paraded Selim, a proud, full-blooded steed, that
stepped as though he disdained the earth he
walked upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="the tory's horse" />
</div>

<p>7. Here the old fellow broke out again: "There,
Mr. Sergeant, there is a horse for you! A charger
fit for a king. Well, my compliments to Colonel
Tarleton. Tell him I have sent him my young
Selim&mdash;my Grand Turk. Say to him that he is
too noble for me, and that the only work fit for
him is to drive the rebels out of the country."
And, to send Selim off in high style, he ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Dick to bring down his new saddle and holsters,
with his silver-mounted pistols. Then, giving
Macdonald a hot breakfast, and lending him a
great-coat, as it was raining, he let him go.</p>

<p>8. The next morning he waited upon Colonel
Tarleton, and told his name, with the smiling
countenance of one who expected to be eaten up
with fondness. But Tarleton treated him as an entire
stranger. After recovering a little, he bluntly
asked Colonel Tarleton how he liked his charger.
"Charger, sir!" replied Tarleton. "Yes, sir, the
elegant horse I sent you yesterday by your sergeant."
"An elegant horse by my sergeant? I
really don't understand this!"</p>

<p>9. The looks and voice of Colonel Tarleton too
sadly convinced the old traitor that he had been
bit, and that young Selim was gone. To have
been outwitted in this manner by a rebel&mdash;to have
lost his peach-brandy, his hot breakfast, his great-coat,
his new saddle, his silver-mounted pistols,
and, worse than all, his darling horse, his young,
full-blooded, bounding Selim&mdash;the sense of all
these losses came crowding upon him so suddenly
that the old sinner liked to have suffocated on the
spot. He grew black in the face, and as soon as
he could recover breath he broke out into a torrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of curses against the rebels generally, and
Macdonald in particular.</p>

<p>10. And Selim! a noble horse he was indeed!
Full sixteen hands high, with the eye of a hawk,
the spirit of a king-eagle, the chest of a lion, swifter
than a roebuck, and strong as a buffalo! Macdonald
kept Selim up lustily to the top of his mettle.
The horse soon learned his master's ways,
and at the first glimpse of the red-coats he would
paw and champ his bit with rage; and the moment
he heard the word "Go!" off he was among
them like a thunderbolt.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="SCHU"></a>XXVI.&mdash;GENERAL SCHUYLER.</h3>

<p>1. In the year 1781 the war was chiefly carried
on in the South, but the North was constantly
troubled by parties of Tories and Indians, who
would swoop down on some small settlements,
and make off with whatever they could lay their
hands on.</p>

<p>2. During this time General Schuyler was staying
at his house, which stood just outside the
stockade or walls of Albany. The British commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sent out a party of Tories and Indians to
capture General Schuyler.</p>

<p>3. When they reached the outskirts of the city,
they learned from a Dutch laborer, whom they
had taken, that the general's house was guarded
by six soldiers, three watching by night, and three
by day. They then let the Dutchman go, after
making him swear an oath of secrecy. This oath
he did not keep very strictly, for, the minute the
band was out of sight, he took to his short legs
and warned the general of their approach.</p>

<p>4. On one of those scorching August days,
when you feel as if you hardly had energy enough
to move, and when the very trees droop their dusty
leaves, too lazy to hold up their heads, Schuyler
and his family were sitting in the large hall, when
a servant entered and told the general that there
was a strange man at the back door who wished
to see him.</p>

<p>5. Schuyler, understanding the trap, gathered
his family in one of the upper rooms, and, giving
orders that the doors and windows should be
barred, fired a pistol from one of the top-story
windows to alarm the neighborhood. The guards,
who had been lounging in the shade of a tree,
started to their feet at the sound of the pistol;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but, alas! too late, for they found themselves surrounded
by a crowd of dusky figures, who bound
them hand and foot, before they had time to resist.</p>

<p>6. In the room up-stairs was the sturdy general,
standing resolutely by the door, with his gun
in hand, his black slaves gathered around him,
each with some weapon. At the other end of the
room the women were huddled together, some
weeping, some praying. Suddenly, a crash is
heard, which chills the very blood, and brings
vividly to each one's mind the tales of Indian
massacres so common at that day. The band had
broken in at one of the windows.</p>

<p>7. At that moment, Mrs. Schuyler springing to
her feet, rushed to the door; for she remembered
that the baby, only a few months old, having been
forgotten in the hour of flight, was asleep in its
cradle on the first floor. But the general, catching
her in his arms, told her that her life was of
more value than her child's, and that, if any one
must go, he would. While, however, this generous
struggle was going on, the third daughter,
gliding past them, was soon at the side of the
cradle. All was as black as night in the hall,
save for a small patch of light just at the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the stairs; this came from the dining-room, where
the Indians could be seen pillaging the shelves,
pulling down the china, and quarreling with one
another over their ill-gotten booty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus092.jpg" width="600" height="392" alt="band of tories and indians in the house" />
</div>

<p>8. How to get past the spot was the question,
but the girl did not hesitate. She reached the
cradle unobserved, and was just darting back with
her precious burden, when, by ill-luck, one of the
savages happened to see her. Whiz! went his
sharp tomahawk, within a few inches of the baby's
head, and, clearing the edge of the brave girl's
dress, stuck deep in the stair-rail.</p>

<p>9. Just then one of the Tories, seeing her flit
by, and supposing her to be a servant, called after
her, "Wench, wench, where is your master?" She,
stopping a moment, called back, "Gone to alarm
the town!" and, hurrying on, was soon again with
her father up-stairs.</p>

<p>10. And now, nearly all the plunder having
been secured, the band was about to proceed to
the real object of the expedition, when the general,
raising one of the windows, called out in lusty
tones, as if commanding a large body of men:
"Come on, my brave fellows! Surround the house!
Secure the villains who are plundering!" The
cowards knew that voice, and they each and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one of them took to the woods as fast as their legs
would carry them, leaving the general in possession
of the field.</p>

<h2>SCOTTISH STORIES.</h2>


<h3><a id="CASTLE"></a>XXVIII.&mdash;EDINBURGH CASTLE.</h3>

<p>1. While Robert Bruce was gradually getting
possession of the country, and driving out the English,
Edinburgh, the principal town of Scotland,
remained with its strong castle in possession of
the invaders. Sir Thomas Randolph was extremely
desirous to gain this important place, but the
castle is situated on a very steep and lofty rock,
so that it is difficult, or almost impossible even, to
get up to the foot of the walls, much more to
climb over them. So, while Randolph was considering
what was to be done, there came to him
a Scottish gentleman, named Francis, who had
joined Bruce's standard, and asked to speak with
him in private. He then told Randolph that in
his youth he had lived in the castle of Edinburgh,
and that his father had then been governor of the
fortress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It happened at that time that Francis was
much in love with a lady who lived in a part of
the town beneath the castle, which is called the
Grass-Market. Now, as he could not get out of
the castle by day to see his mistress, he had practiced
a way of clambering by night down the
castle crag on the steep side, and returning up at
his pleasure; when he came to the foot of the wall
he made use of a ladder to get over it, as it was
not very high on that point, those who built it
having trusted to the steepness of the crag. Francis
had gone and come so frequently in this dangerous
manner that, though it was now long ago,
he told Randolph he knew the road so well that
he would undertake to guide a small party of
men by night to the bottom of the wall, and, as
they might bring ladders with them, there would
be no difficulty in scaling it. The great risk was
that of their being discovered by the watchmen
while in the act of ascending the cliff, in which
case every man of them must perish.</p>

<p>3. Nevertheless, Randolph did not hesitate to
attempt the adventure. He took with him only
thirty men, and came one dark night to the foot
of the crag, which they began to ascend under the
guidance of Francis, who went before them, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his hands and feet, where there was scarce room
to support themselves. All the while these thirty
men were obliged to follow in a line, one after
the other, by a path that was fitter for a cat
than for a man. The noise of a stone falling, or
a word spoken from one to another, would have
alarmed the watchmen. They were obliged, therefore,
to move with the greatest precaution. When
they were far up the crag, and near the foundation
of the wall, they heard the guards going their
rounds, to see that all was safe in and about the
castle.</p>

<p>4. Randolph and his party had nothing for it
but to lie close and quiet, each man under the
crag, as he happened to be placed, and trust that
the guards would pass by without noticing them.
And while they were waiting in breathless alarm,
they got a new cause of fright. One of the soldiers
of the castle, willing to startle his comrades,
suddenly threw a stone from the wall, and cried
out, "Aha! I see you well!" The stone came
thundering down over the heads of Randolph and
his men, who naturally thought themselves discovered.
If they had stirred, or made the slightest
noise, they would have been destroyed, for the
soldiers above might have killed every man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
them, merely by rolling down stones. But being
courageous and chosen men, they remained quiet,
and the English soldiers, who thought their comrade
was merely playing them a trick (as indeed
he was), passed on, without further examination.</p>

<p>5. Then Randolph and his men got up and
came in haste to the foot of the wall, which was
not above twice a man's height in that place.
They planted the ladders they had brought, and
Francis mounted first to show them the way; Sir
Andrew Grey, a brave knight, followed him; and
Randolph himself was the third man who got over.
Then the rest followed. When once they were
within the walls, there was not so much to do, for
the garrison were asleep, and unarmed, excepting
the watch, who were speedily destroyed. Thus
was Edinburgh Castle taken, in the year 1312-'13.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="SCOT"></a>XXIX.&mdash;SCOTTISH STRATEGY.</h3>

<p>1. There was a strong castle near Linlithgow,
where an English governor, with a powerful garrison,
lay in readiness to support the English
cause, and used to exercise much severity upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Scotch in the neighborhood. There lived, at no
great distance from this stronghold, a farmer, a
bold and stout man, whose name was Binnock,
or, as it is now pronounced, Binning. This man
saw with great joy the progress which the Scotch
were making in recovering their country from the
English, and resolved to do something to help his
countrymen, by getting possession, if it were possible,
of the Castle of Linlithgow. But the place
was very strong, situated by the side of a lake,
defended not only by gates, which were usually
kept shut against strangers, but also by a portcullis.
A portcullis is a sort of door formed of
cross-bars of iron, like a gate. It has not hinges
like a door, but is drawn up by pulleys, and let
down when any danger approaches. It may be
let go in a moment, and then falls down into the
doorway, and, as it has great iron spikes at the
bottom, it crushes all that it lights upon; and in
case of a sudden alarm, a portcullis may be let
suddenly fall, to defend the entrance when it is not
possible to shut the gates. Binnock knew this
very well, but he resolved to be provided against
this risk also when he attempted to surprise the
castle.</p>

<p>2. So he spoke with some bold, courageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
countrymen, and engaged them in the enterprise,
which he accomplished thus: Binnock had been
accustomed to supply the garrison of Linlithgow
with hay, and he had been ordered by the English
governor to furnish some cart-loads, of which
they were in want. He promised to bring it accordingly;
but, in the night before he drove the
hay to the castle, he stationed a party of his
friends, as well armed as possible, near the entrance,
where they could not be seen by the garrison,
and gave them directions that they should
come to his assistance as soon as they should hear
him give a signal, which was to be, "Call all, call
all!" Then he loaded his cart, and placed eight
strong men, well armed, lying flat on their breasts,
and covered over with hay, so that they could
not be seen. He himself walked carelessly beside
the wagon; and he chose the stoutest and bravest
of his servants to be the driver, who carried at
his belt a stout axe or hatchet.</p>

<p>3. In this way Binnock approached the castle
early in the morning; and the watchman, who
only saw two men, Binnock being one of them,
with a cart of hay, which they expected, opened
the gates, and raised up the portcullis to permit
them to enter the castle. But as soon as the cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had got under the gateway, Binnock made a sign
to his servant, who with his axe suddenly cut
asunder the soam (that is, the yoke which fastens
the horses to the cart), and the horses, finding themselves
free, naturally started forward, the cart remaining
behind. At the same moment Binnock
cried, as loud as he could, "Call all, call all!" and
drawing his sword, which he had under his country
habit, he killed the porter. The armed men
then jumped up from under the hay, where they
lay concealed, and rushed on the English guard.
The Englishmen tried to shut the gates, but they
could not, because the cart of hay remained in the
gateway, and prevented the folding-doors from
being closed. The portcullis was also let fall, but
the grating was caught on the cart, and so could
not drop to the ground. The men who were in
ambush near the gate, hearing the cry, "Call all,
call all!" ran to assist those who had leaped out
from among the hay; the castle was taken, and all
the Englishmen killed or made prisoners. King
Robert rewarded Binnock by bestowing on him
an estate, which his posterity afterward enjoyed.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="DANG"></a>XXX.&mdash;CASTLE DANGEROUS.</h3>

<p>1. Roxburgh was then a very large castle,
situated near where two fine rivers, the Tweed
and the Teviot, join each other. Being within
five or six miles of the border, the English were
extremely desirous of retaining it, and the Scots
equally so of obtaining possession of it.</p>

<p>2. It was upon the night of what is called
Shrove-tide, a holiday, which Roman Catholics
paid great respect to, and solemnized, with much
gayety and feasting.</p>

<p>3. Most of the garrison of Roxburgh Castle
were feasting and drinking, but still they had set
watches on the battlements of the castle, in case
of any sudden attack; for, as the Scots had succeeded
in so many enterprises of the kind, and
as Douglas was known to be in the neighborhood,
they thought themselves obliged to keep a
very strict guard.</p>

<p>4. There was also an Englishwoman, the wife
of one of the officers, who was sitting on the battlements
with her child in her arms, and, looking
out on the fields below, she saw some black objects,
like a herd of cattle, straggling in near the
foot of the wall, and approaching the ditch or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
moat of the castle. She pointed them out to the
sentinel, and asked him what they were. "Pooh,
pooh!" said the soldier, "it is Farmer Such-a-man's
cattle" (naming a man whose farm lay near
to the castle). "The good man is keeping a jolly
Shrove-tide, and has forgot to shut up his bullocks
in their yard; but if the Douglas come across them
before morning, he is likely to rue his negligence."</p>

<p>5. Now, these creeping objects they saw from
the castle were no real cattle, but Douglas himself
and his soldiers, who had put black cloaks above
their armor, and were creeping about on their hands
and feet, in order, without being observed, to get
so near to the foot of the castle-wall as to be able
to set ladders to it. The poor woman, who knew
nothing of this, sat quietly on the wall, and began
to sing to her child. You must know that
the name of Douglas was become so terrible to
the English, that the women used to frighten their
children with it, and say to them, when they behaved
ill, that they would make the Black Douglas
take them. And this soldier's wife was singing to
her child:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Hush ye, hush ye, little pet ye;</div>
<div class="verse">Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye;</div>
<div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get thee."</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p class="uni">"You are not so sure of that!" said a voice close
beside her. She felt at that moment a heavy
hand, with an iron glove, laid on her shoulder, and
when she looked round, she saw the very Black
Douglas, she had been singing about, standing
close beside her, a tall, swarthy, strong man. At
the same time another Scotsman was seen ascending
the walls near to the sentinel. The soldier
gave the alarm, and rushed at the Scotsman, whose
name was Simon Ledehouse, with his lance; but
Simon parried the blow, and, closing with the sentinel,
struck him a deadly blow with his dagger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus104.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="Douglas, the Englishwoman and the child" />
</div>

<p>6. The rest of the Scots followed to assist
Douglas and Ledehouse, and the castle was taken.
Many of the soldiers were put to death, but Douglas
protected the woman and the child. I dare
say she made no more songs about the Black
Douglas.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="BLACK"></a>XXXI.&mdash;THE BLACK AGNES.</h3>

<p>1. Among the warlike exploits of this period,
we must not forget the defense of the Castle
of Dunbar, by the celebrated Countess of March.
Her lord had embraced the side of David Bruce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and had taken the field with the regent. The
countess, who from her complexion was termed
Black Agnes, by which name she is still familiarly
remembered, was a high-spirited and courageous
woman, the daughter of Thomas Randolph, Earl
of Moray, and the heiress of his valor and patriotism.
The Castle of Dunbar itself was very
strong, being built upon a chain of rocks stretching
into the sea, having only one passage to the
mainland, which was well fortified. It was
besieged by Montague, Earl of Salisbury, who
employed to destroy its walls great military engines,
constructed to throw huge stones, with which
machines fortifications were attacked before the
use of cannon.</p>

<p>2. Black Agnes set all his attempts at defiance,
and showed herself with her maids on the walls
of the castle, wiping the places where the huge
stones fell with a clean towel, as if they could do
no ill to her castle, save raising a little dust, which
a napkin could wipe away. The Earl of Salisbury
then commanded them to bring forward to the
assault an engine of another kind, being a species
of wooden shed, or house, rolled forward on
wheels, with a roof of peculiar strength, which
from resembling the ridge of a hog's back, occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the machine to be called a sow. This, according
to the old mode of warfare, was thrust up
to the walls of a besieged castle or city, and served
to protect from the arrows and stones of the besieged
a party of soldiers placed within the sow,
who were in the mean while to undermine the
wall, or break an entrance through it with pick-axes
and mining-tools. When the Countess of
March saw this engine advanced to the walls of
the castle, she called out to the Earl of Salisbury
in derision, and making a kind of rhyme&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Beware, Montagow,</div>
<div class="verse">For farrow shall thy sow!"</div>
</div>

<p class="uni">At the same time she made a signal, and a huge
fragment of rock, which hung prepared for the
purpose, was dropped down from the wall upon
the sow, whose roof was thus dashed to pieces.
As the English soldiers who had been within it
were running away as fast as they could to get
out of the way of the arrows and stones from the
wall, Black Agnes called out, "Behold the litters
of English pigs!"</p>

<p>3. The Earl of Salisbury could jest also on
such serious occasions. One day he rode near the
walls with a knight dressed in armor of proof,
having three folds of mail over an acton, or leathern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
jacket: notwithstanding which, one William
Spens shot an arrow with such force that it penetrated
all these defenses and reached the heart
of the wearer. "That is one of my lady's love-tokens,"
said the earl, as he saw the knight fall
dead from his horse. "Black Agnes's love-shafts
pierce to the heart!"</p>

<p>4. Upon another occasion, the Countess of
March had well-nigh made the Earl of Salisbury
her prisoner. She made one of her people enter
into a treaty with the besiegers, pretending to
betray the castle. Trusting to this agreement, the
earl came at midnight before the gate, which he
found open, and the portcullis drawn up. As Salisbury
was about to enter, one John Copland, a
squire of Northumberland, pressed on before him,
and, as soon as he passed the threshold, the portcullis
was dropped; and thus the Scots missed
their principal prey, and made prisoner only a
person of inferior condition.</p>

<p>5. At length, the Castle of Dunbar was relieved
by Alexander Ramsay, of Dalwolsy, who
brought the countess supplies by sea, both of men
and provisions. The Earl of Salisbury, learning
this, despaired of success, and raised the siege,
which had lasted nineteen weeks. The minstrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
made songs in praise of the perseverance and courage
of Black Agnes. The following lines are
nearly the sense of what is preserved:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse i4">6. "She kept a stir in tower and trench,</div>
<div class="verse">The brawling, boisterous Scottish wench;</div>
<div class="verse">Came I early, came I late,</div>
<div class="verse">I found Agnes at the gate."</div>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS STORIES.</h2>


<h3><a id="MAID"></a>XXXII.&mdash;A LITTLE MAID.</h3>

<p>1. Away off in the beautiful country of Greece,
a long, long time ago, there lived a little maiden,
the daughter of a king. Her name was Gorgo&mdash;not
a very pretty name, perhaps, to us who are
used to calling little girls Maud and Ethel and
Helen, but a strong name, and therefore quite
appropriate to the little maid who bore it, as you
shall see. In those old times there used to be
many wars, and the country of Sparta, the part
of Greece where Gorgo lived, was famous for its
brave warriors, who never thought for a moment
of their own safety when their country was in
danger. Sometimes these were not good wars,
but wars for spite and revenge, instead of for freedom
and for loyalty to beautiful Greece.</p>

<p>2. Some wicked man would wish to avenge
an injury he had received, and in order to do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he would go about among the different kingdoms
and persuade the rulers to join with him and try
to overcome his enemy; and then there would be
terrible bloodshed in order to satisfy one wicked
man's revenge. Aristagoras was such a man as
this. He was dissatisfied with his king, and
wished to become a king himself instead. One
day he came to Sparta on this evil errand, and
tried to persuade King Cleomenes, the father of
little Gorgo, to help his base project. He talked
with the king a long time. He promised him
power and honor and money if he would do as
he wished; more and more money, and, as the
king refused, still more and more money he offered,
and at last the king almost consented.</p>

<p>3. But it had happened that when Aristagoras
had come into the presence of the king, the king's
little daughter was standing by his side with her
hand in his. Aristagoras wanted Cleomenes to
send her away, for he knew very well that it is
much harder to induce a man to do something
wrong when there is a dear little child at his side.
But the king had said, "No, say what you have
to say in her presence, too." And so little Gorgo
had sat at her father's feet, looking up into his
face with her innocent eyes, and listening intently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to all that was said. She felt that something was
wrong, and when she saw her father look troubled
and hesitate, and cast down his eyes, she knew
the strange visitor was trying to make him do
something he did not quite want to do. She
stole her little hand softly into her father's, and
said, "Papa, come away&mdash;come, or this strange
man will make you do wrong."</p>

<p>4. This made the king feel strong again, and,
clasping the little maid's hand tightly in his own,
he rose and left the tempter, and went away with
the child who had saved him and his country
from dishonor. Gorgo was only ten years old
then, but she was worthy to be a king's daughter,
because, being good and true herself, she helped
her father to be good and true also.</p>

<p>5. When she grew to be a woman she became
the wife of a king, and then she showed herself as
noble a queen as she had been a princess. Her
husband was that King Leonidas who stood in
the narrow pass of Thermopylæ with his small
army, and fought back the great hosts of the
Persians until he and all his heroic band were
killed. But, before this happened, there was a
time when the Grecians did not know that the
great Persian army was coming to try and destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
them, and a friend of theirs, who was a prisoner in
the country where the great Xerxes lived, wishing
to warn the Spartans of the coming of the Persians,
so that they might prepare, sent a messenger to
King Leonidas. But when the messenger arrived,
all he had to show for his message was a bare,
white waxen tablet. The king and all the lords
puzzled over this strange tablet a long time, but
could make nothing out of it. At last they began
to think it was done for a jest, and did not mean
anything.</p>

<p>6. But just then the young Queen Gorgo said,
"Let me take it," and after looking it all over she
exclaimed, "There must be some writing underneath
the wax!" They scraped away the wax
from the tablet, and there, sure enough, written on
the wood beneath, was the message of the Grecian
prisoner and his warning to King Leonidas.</p>

<p>7. Thus Gorgo helped her country a second
time; for, if the Spartans had not known that the
army was coming, they could not have warned the
other kingdoms, and perhaps the Persians would
not have been conquered. But as it was, Leonidas
and the other kings called their armies
together, and, when the Persian host came sweeping
over the plains, the Greeks were ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
meet them, and to fight and die for their beautiful
Greece.</p>

<p>8. So this one little maid of hundreds of years
ago, princess and queen, helped to save her father
from disgrace and her country from ruin. And
we may feel sure that she was strong and true to
the last, even when her brave husband, Leonidas,
lay dead in the fearful pass of Thermopylæ, and
she was left to mourn in the royal palace at
Sparta.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="ALEX"></a>XXXIII.&mdash;ALEXANDER SELKIRK.</h3>

<p>1. Nearly two hundred years ago, an Englishman,
living in London, named Daniel Defoe,
wrote the story of Robinson Crusoe to interest
and amuse boys and girls. Only think of it! Before
that time nobody knew anything about the
lonely island, or about the ship that was wrecked
there. Nobody could know that Robinson was
washed ashore and saved. Nobody could see him
build his hut, and plan how to live day by day.
Nobody could see his tame goats run out to meet
him, or hear his parrot cry, "Poor Robinson Crusoe!"
Nobody could form the acquaintance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the faithful man Friday, whom Robinson saved
from the cannibals, and who became such a dear
friend to him. None of this could any boy or girl
at that time enjoy, because the story had not yet
come out of the head of Defoe.</p>

<p>2. But, while Robinson Crusoe is a story that
never really happened, Daniel Defoe had something
to make it out of. In 1704 a Scotch sailor,
named Alexander Selkirk, then twenty-eight years
old, was left upon Juan Fernandez, an uninhabited
island in the Pacific, off the coast of Chili. He
had quarreled with the captain of the ship in
which he sailed, and the captain sent him ashore
to improve his temper. Here he lived alone for
four years and four months, when, an English vessel
appearing, he was carried back to his native
country.</p>

<p>3. About half of what is said to have happened
to Robinson Crusoe really happened to
Alexander Selkirk. The hut was built; search
was made for food; fish were drawn from the
water, and turtles found upon the shore. Cabbage-palm
grew in the woods, and, from seeds found
in the wrecked vessels, turnips, parsnips, and radishes
were grown. The goats, too, were a living
reality, and, when his powder gave out, the active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
young Scotchman could run down a young goat,
and so secure a dinner.</p>

<p>4. Here
this sailor
remained during the long years, busy and lonesome.
The poet Cowper has supposed that he
was made entirely unhappy by his longing for
society and friends, and has expressed his supposed
sentiments in the following poem:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse i2">I am lord of the fowl and the brute.</div>
<div class="verse">O Solitude! where are the charms</div>
<div class="verse i2">That sages have seen in thy face?</div>
<div class="verse">Better dwell in the midst of alarms,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>10. Selkirk might sometimes have indulged in
thoughts like these, but generally he was too busy
to give much heed to them. Besides, the life itself
had its charms, and, after his rough usage upon
the ship, he keenly felt the joy of perfect freedom.
Then the animals which he tamed began to appear
as real friends, and, though no man Friday came
to cheer and comfort him, he began to really love
his new home and enjoy the life which he led.</p>

<p>11. This is the account given of the appearance
of Selkirk by Rogers, captain of the vessel
that finally took Selkirk off from the island: "At
night, after we came to anchor, we discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bright light upon the island. In the morning we
sent our yawl ashore with six men, all armed, and,
as it was gone some time, we sent our pinnace,
with the men armed, for we were afraid lest the
Spaniards were there and had seized our boat.
We put out a signal for the boat, when our pinnace
returned from the shore and brought abundance
of craw-fish, with a man clothed in goat-skins,
who looked wilder than the first owners of
them. At his first coming on board us, he had so
much forgot his language for want of use that one
could scarcely understand him, for he seemed to
speak his words by halves. We offered him a
dram, but he would not touch it, having drunk
nothing but water since he came upon the island,
and it was some time before he could relish our
victuals.</p>

<p>12. "He took goats by speed of foot, for his
way of living, and continual exercise of walking
and running, cleared him of all gross humors, so
that he ran with wonderful swiftness through the
woods, and up the rocks and hills. We had a
bull-dog, which we sent with several of our nimblest
runners, to help him in catching goats, but he
tired both the dog and men, caught the goats, and
brought them back to us. Being forced to shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
without shoes, his feet had become so hard that he
ran everywhere without annoyance; and it was
some time before he could wear shoes after we
found him; for, not being used to any so long, his
feet swelled when he came first to use them
again."</p>

<p>13. Selkirk returned to his native country,
married, and settled down to a steady life. He
never forgot his lonely isle, and often wished himself
back among his goats and cats. He learned
dram-drinking once more, and, as he began to eat
and drink as people did around him, he lost much
of the health and strength which he gained in his
solitary home. From him we may all learn that
the simple, natural way of living may be the best
for us in giving us health to enjoy life and perform
our duties.</p>

<h3><a id="SCHOOL"></a>XXXIV.&mdash;THE OLD-FASHIONED SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>1. Imagine yourselves in Master Ezekiel Cheever's
school-room. It is a large, dingy room, with
a sanded floor, and is lighted by windows that
turn on hinges, and have little, diamond-shaped
panes of glass. The scholars sit on long benches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with desks before them. At one end of the room
is a great fireplace, so spacious that there is room
enough for three or four boys to stand in each
of the chimney-corners. This was the good old
fashion of fireplaces when there was wood enough
in the forests to keep people warm without their
digging into the bowels of the earth for coal.</p>

<p>2. It is a winter's day when we take our peep
into the school-room. See what logs of wood have
been rolled into the fireplace, and what a broad,
bright blaze goes leaping up the chimney! And
every few moments a vast cloud of smoke is puffed
into the room, which sails slowly over the heads
of the scholars, until it gradually settles upon the
walls and ceiling. They are blackened with the
smoke of many years already.</p>

<p>3. Do you see the venerable schoolmaster, severe
in aspect, with a black skull-cap on his head,
like an ancient Puritan, and the snow of his white
beard drifting down to his very girdle? What
boy would dare to play or whisper, or even glance
aside from his book, while Master Cheever is on
the outlook behind his spectacles? For such
offenders, if any such there be, a rod of birch is
hanging over the fireplace, and a heavy ferule lies
on the master's desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus122.jpg" width="500" height="442" alt="the old-fashioned school" />
</div>

<p>4. And now school is begun. What a murmur
of multitudinous tongues, like the whispering of
leaves of a wind-stirred oak, as the scholars con
over their various tasks! Buzz! buzz! buzz!
Amid just such a murmur has Master Cheever
spent about sixty years; and long habit has made
it as pleasant to him as the hum of a bee-hive
when the insects are busy in the sunshine. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a class in Latin is called to recite. Forth steps a
row of queer-looking little fellows, wearing square-skirted
coats and small-clothes, with buttons at the
knee. They look like so many grandfathers in
their second childhood.</p>

<p>5. These lads are to be sent to Cambridge and
educated for the learned professions. Old Master
Cheever has lived so long, and seen so many generations
of school-boys grow up to be men, that
now he can almost prophesy what sort of a man
each boy will be. One urchin shall hereafter be a
doctor, and administer pills and potions, and stalk
gravely through life, perfumed with asaf&oelig;tida.
Another shall wrangle at the bar, and fight his
way to wealth and honors, and, in his declining
age, shall be a worshipful member of his Majesty's
Council. A third shall be a worthy successor to
the old Puritan ministers now in their graves.
But as they are merely school-boys now, their
business is to construe Virgil.</p>

<p>6. Next comes a class in arithmetic. These
boys are to be the merchants, shopkeepers, and
mechanics of a future period. Hitherto they have
traded only in marbles and apples. Others will
upheave the blacksmith's hammer, or drive the
plane over the carpenter's bench, or take the lapstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and the awl, and learn the trade of shoemaking.
Many will follow the sea, and become
bold, rough sea-captains. Wherefore, teach them
their multiplication-table, good Master Cheever,
and whip them well when they deserve it; for
much of the country's welfare depends on these
boys.</p>

<p>7. But, alas! Master Cheever's watchful eye
has caught two boys at play. Now we shall see
awful times. The malefactors are summoned before
the master's chair. Master Cheever has taken
down that terrible birch-rod! Short is the trial&mdash;the
sentence quickly passed&mdash;and now the judge
prepares to execute it in person. Thwack!
thwack! thwack! In those good old times a
schoolmaster's blows were well laid on. And thus
the forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve
o'clock. The master looks at his great silver
watch, and then, with tiresome deliberation, puts
the ferule into the desk. "You are dismissed,"
says Master Cheever.</p>

<p>8. The boys retire, treading softly until they
have passed the threshold; but fairly out of the
school-room lo, what a joyous shout! What a
scampering and trampling of feet! What care
they for the ferule and birch-rod now? Were boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
created merely to study Latin and arithmetic? No;
the better purposes of their being are to sport, to
leap, to run, to shout, to slide upon the ice, to
snow-ball. Happy boys! Enjoy your play-time
now, and come again to study and to feel the
birch-rod and the ferule to-morrow.</p>

<p>9. Now the master has set everything to rights,
and is ready to go home to dinner. Yet he goes
reluctantly. The old man has spent so much of
his life in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room,
that, when he has a holiday, he feels as if his
place were lost, and himself a stranger in the
World.</p>

<h3><a id="KITE"></a>XXXV.&mdash;STORY OF FRANKLIN'S KITE.</h3>

<p>1. It was in the spring of 1752 that Franklin
thought of trying the experiment with a kite;
and it was during one of the June thunder-storms
of that year that the immortal kite was flown.</p>

<p>2. Who does not know the story? How he
made his kite of a large silk handkerchief, and
fastened to the top of the perpendicular stick a
piece of sharpened iron wire. How he stole away,
upon the approach of a storm, into the common not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
far from his own house, say about the corner of
Race and Eighth Streets, near a spot where there
was an old cow-shed. How, wishing to avoid the
ridicule of possible failure, he told no one what he
was going to do, except his son, who accompanied
him, and who was then not the small boy he is
represented in a hundred pictures, but a braw lad
of twenty-two, one of the beaux of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>3. How the kite was raised in time for the
coming gust, the string being hempen, except the
part held in the hand, which was silk. How, at
the termination of the hempen string, a common
key was fastened; and in the shed was deposited
a Leyden bottle, in which to collect from the
clouds, if the clouds should contain it, the material
requisite for an electric shock. How father
and son stood for some time under the shed, presenting
the spectacle, if there had been any one to
behold it, of two escaped lunatics, flying a kite in
the rain; the young gentleman, no doubt, feeling
a little foolish. How, at last, when a thunder-cloud
appeared to pass directly over the kite, and
yet no sign of electricity appeared the hopes of
the father, too, began to grow faint. How, when
both were ready to despair of success, Franklin's
heart stood still as he suddenly observed the fibers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the hempen string to rise, as a boy's hair rises
when he stands on the insulating-stool. How,
with eager, trembling hand, he applied his knuckle
to the key, and drew therefrom an unmistakable
spark, and another and another, and as many as
he chose. How the Leyden vial was charged,
and both received the most thrilling shock ever
experienced by man; a shock that might have
been figuratively styled electric, if electric it had
not really been. How, the wet kite being drawn
in, and the apparatus packed, the philosopher went
home exulting, the happiest philosopher in Christendom.</p>

<p>4. And this was only the beginning of triumph.
The next ships that arrived from the Old World
brought him the news that the same experiment,
in the mode originally suggested by him, of erecting
an iron rod upon an eminence, had been successfully
performed in France, so that his name
had suddenly become one of the most famous in
Europe.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="CASE"></a>XXXVI.&mdash;THE CASE OF JOHN HOOK.</h3>

<p>1. Wirt, in his life of Patrick Henry, gives
this specimen of the eloquence of the great orator.
In Campbell County, Virginia, lived a Scotchman,
named Hook, who was suspected of being a Tory.
The American army was greatly distressed for
food, and a commissary, named Venable, took two
of Hook's steers, without his consent, to feed the
starving soldiers. After the war, a lawyer, named
Cowan, advised Hook to sue Venable for trespass.
Venable employed Patrick Henry. The
case was tried in the old court-house in New London.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Henry depicted the distress of the
American army in the most gloomy colors, and
then asked: "Where was the man with an American
heart, who would not have thrown open his
fields, his barns, his cellars, the doors of his house,
the portals of his breast, to have received with
open arms the meanest soldier of that little band
of famished patriots? Where is the man? There
he stands; but whether the heart of an American
beats in his bosom, you, gentlemen, are to judge?"
He then carried the jury, by the powers of his
imagination, to the plains around York, the surrender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of which had followed shortly after the act
complained of.</p>

<p>3. He depicted the surrender in the most glowing
and noble colors of his eloquence. The audience
saw before their eyes the dejection of the
British as they marched out of the trenches; they
saw the triumph which lighted up every patriotic
face, and heard the shouts of victory and the cry
of "Washington and liberty!" as it rang through
the American ranks and echoed back from hill
and shore. "But hark! what notes of discord are
these which disturb the general joy? They are
notes of John Hook, hoarsely bawling through the
American camp, '<em>Beef! beef! beef!</em>'"</p>

<p>4. The whole audience was convulsed. The
clerk of the court, unable to contain himself, and
unwilling to disturb the court, rushed out of the
court-house and threw himself on the grass in the
most violent paroxysm of laughter, where he was
rolling when Hook, with very different feelings,
came out into the yard for relief also. "Jemmy
Steptoe," he said to the clerk, "what ails ye, mon?"
Mr. Steptoe was only able to say that he could
not help it. "Never mind ye," said Hook; "wait
till Billy Cowan gets up; he'll show him the la'!"
But Mr. Cowan could scarcely utter a word. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
jury instantly returned a verdict against Hook.
The people were highly excited, and Hook was
obliged to leave the county to avoid a coat of tar
and feathers.</p>

<h3><a id="STEAM"></a>XXXVII.&mdash;THE FIRST STEAMBOAT IN THE
WEST.</h3>

<p>1. Many things combined to make the year
1811 the wonderful year of the West. During
the earlier months, the waters of many of the great
rivers overflowed their banks, so that the whole
country was covered from bluff to bluff. Widespread
sickness followed, such as had never before
been known. A spirit of change and uneasiness
seemed to seize the very inhabitants of the forest.
A countless multitude of squirrels, obeying some
great and universal impulse, left their joyous,
gamboling life and their ancient retreats in the
North, and were seen pressing forward by tens
of thousands in a deep and sober phalanx to the
South. No obstacles seemed to check this extraordinary
and united movement. The word had
been given them to go forth, and they obeyed it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
though multitudes perished in the broad Ohio,
which lay in their path.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus131.jpg" width="500" height="356" alt="the first steamboat in the west" />
</div>

<p>2. The splendid comet of that year long continued
to shed its twilight over the forests. As
the autumn drew to a close, the whole Mississippi
Valley, from the Missouri to the Gulf, was shaken
to its center by continued earthquakes. It was at
this very time, when so many extraordinary events
of Nature combined to spread wonder and awe,
that the first steamboat was seen descending the
great rivers, and the awe-struck Indian on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
banks beheld the Pinelore, or "fire-canoe," flying
through the turbid waters.</p>

<p>3. The banks of the Ohio and its tributaries
were covered with innumerable farms; and rafts,
flat-boats, and barges of every description, laden
with the produce, floated upon its wide surface,
toward the general market of the West, New Orleans.
Besides the barges and vessels of heavy
burden, which made their long annual voyage to
and from the city, the river was covered, particularly
in time of flood, by thousands of queer machines,
for boats they can hardly be called, most
of which soon disappeared. From seventy to
eighty days were consumed in thus effecting the
long and monotonous voyage from Pittsburg to
New Orleans.</p>

<p>4. The experiments in steam navigation made
on the Hudson River and adjoining waters, previous
to the year 1809, were attended with complete
success. Attention was now paid to the Western
rivers, and Mr. Roosevelt, of New York, accompanied
by Mr. Fulton, visited these rivers to see
whether they would admit of steam navigation.
At this time two boats, the North River and the
Clermont, were running on the Hudson. Mr.
Roosevelt surveyed the rivers from Pittsburg to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
New Orleans, and made a favorable report, and it
was decided to build a boat at the former town.</p>

<p>5. Accordingly, during the year 1811 the first
boat was launched on the waters of the Ohio. It
was called the Orleans, and was intended to
ply between Natchez, in the State of Mississippi,
and the city whose name it bore. In October it
left Pittsburg for a trial voyage. No freight or
passengers were taken. Mr. Roosevelt with his
family; Mr. Baker, the engineer; Andrew Jack, the
pilot; and six hands, with a few domestics, formed
her whole burden. There were no wood-yards at
that time, and constant delays were unavoidable.</p>

<p>6. Late at night on the fourth day after quitting
Pittsburg, they arrived safely at Louisville,
having been but seventy hours descending upward
of seven hundred miles. The novel appearance
of the vessel, and the fearful rapidity with which
it made its passage over the broad reaches of the
river, excited both terror and surprise among many
of the settlers along the banks, whom the rumor
of such an invention had never reached.</p>

<p>7. The unexpected arrival of the boat at Louisville,
in the course of a fine, still, moonlight night,
created a great stir. The extraordinary sound
which filled the air as the pent-up steam was suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to escape on rounding to, produced a general
alarm, and multitudes in the town rose from their
beds to see what was the matter. It was related
that an impression widely prevailed that the comet
had fallen into the Ohio.</p>

<p>8. The low stage of water caused a detention
at Louisville until the last week in November,
when the voyage was resumed. When the boat
arrived at a point five miles above the Yellow
Banks, she was moored to take in wood. While
thus engaged, our voyagers were accosted in great
alarm by the squatters of the neighborhood, who
inquired if they had heard strange noises on the
river and in the woods on the preceding day, or
had seen the shores shake.</p>

<p>9. Hitherto nothing extraordinary had been
perceived. The following day they pursued their
monotonous voyage in those vast solitudes. The
air was misty, still, and dull. Though the sun
was visible, like a glowing ball of copper, his rays
hardly shed more than a mournful twilight on the
surface of the water. Evening drew nigh, and
with it some indications of what was passing
around them became evident. And as they sat
on deck, they ever and anon heard a rushing sound
and violent splash, and saw large portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
shore tearing away from the land and falling into
the river.</p>

<p>10. It was, as my informant said, "an awful
day, so still that you could have heard a pin drop
on the deck." They spoke little, for every one on
board appeared thunderstruck. The comet had
disappeared about this time, which circumstance
was noticed with awe by the crew. The trees
were seen waving and nodding on the bank without
a wind. Toward evening of the second day
they found themselves at a loss for a place of shelter.
The pilot said that he was lost; that the
channel was everywhere altered. A large island
in mid-channel familiar to the pilot was sought in
vain, having entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>11. Thus in doubt and terror, they proceeded
hour after hour till dark, when they found a small
island and rounded-to. Here they lay, keeping
watch on deck during the long autumnal night,
and listening to the sound of the roaring waters.
Several times in the course of the night earthquake-shocks
were felt. It was a long night, but
morning dawned and showed them that they were
near the mouth of the Ohio.</p>

<p>12. About noon that day they reached the
small town of New Madrid, on the right bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Mississippi. Here they found the inhabitants
in the greatest distress and consternation. Part of
the population had fled in terror to the higher
grounds; others prayed to be taken on board, as
the earth was opening in fissures on every side,
and their houses hourly falling around them.</p>

<p>13. At that time you floated for three or four
hundred miles on the rivers without seeing a
human habitation. Proceeding from New Madrid,
after many days of great danger, they reached
their destination at Natchez in January, 1812, to
the great astonishment of all, the escape of the
boat having been considered an impossibility.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="POWER"></a>XXXVIII.&mdash;THE POWER OF KINDNESS.</h3>

<p>1. William Savery was a Quaker, living near
Philadelphia, during the Revolutionary War. He
was a kindly-disposed man, and many were his
charitable deeds that the public knew nothing
about. He was a tanner by trade, and one night
a number of hides were stolen from his yard.
While he suspected a neighbor of his, a worthless
sort of fellow, he had no proof against him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
said nothing about his loss, but the next day the
following advertisement appeared in the papers:</p>

<p>2. "Whoever stole a lot of hides on the 5th
of the present month, is hereby informed that the
owner has a sincere wish to be his friend. If
poverty tempted him to this false step, the owner
will keep the whole matter secret, and will gladly
put him in the way of obtaining a living by means
more likely to bring him peace of mind."</p>

<p>3. This odd notice attracted a good deal of attention;
but the thief alone knew from whom the
kind offer came. When he read it, his heart was
filled with sorrow for what he had done. A few
nights afterward, as the tanner's family were about
going to bed, they heard a timid knock; and, when
the door opened, there stood Smith, with the hides
on his shoulder. Without looking up, he said: "I
have brought these back, Mr. Savery. Where
shall I put them?"</p>

<p>4. "Wait till I can light a lantern, and I will
go to the barn with thee," replied Mr. Savery.
"Then, perhaps, thou wilt come in and tell me
how this thing happened, and we will see what
can be done for thee."</p>

<p>5. As soon as they were gone out, his wife prepared
some hot coffee, and placed pies and meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
on the table. When they returned from the barn,
she said, "Neighbor Smith, I thought some hot
supper would do thee good." Smith turned his
back toward her, and did not speak. After a moment,
he said in a choked voice: "It is the first
time I ever stole anything, and I feel very bad
about it. I don't know how it is. I am sure I
didn't think once that I should ever come to be what
I am. But I took to drinking, and then to quarreling.
And since I began to go down-hill, everybody
gives me a kick. You are the first man,
Mr. Savery, that has ever offered me a helping
hand. God bless you! I stole the hides from
you, meaning to sell them. But I tell you the
truth, when I say it is the first time I was ever a
thief."</p>

<p>6. "Let it be the last time, my friend," replied
William Savery. "The secret shall be between
me and thee. Thou art still young. Promise me
that thou will not drink any more liquor for a
year, and I will employ thee to-morrow at good
wages. Perhaps we may find some work for thy
family also. The little boy can at least pick up
stones. But eat a bit now, and drink some hot
coffee, to keep thee from craving anything stronger.
Keep up a brave heart for the sake of thy wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and children. When thou hast need of coffee, tell
Mary, and she will always give it to thee."</p>

<p>7. The poor fellow tried hard to eat and drink,
but the food seemed to choke him. He could not
smother his feelings, and he bowed his head on
the table and wept like a child. By-and-by he
ate and drank with good heart; and his host
parted with him for the night with this kindly
word, "Try to do well, John, and thou wilt always
find a friend in me."</p>

<p>8. Smith began to work for him the next day,
and remained with him many years, a sober, honest,
and faithful man. The secret of the theft
was kept between them; but, after John's death,
William Savery told the story, to show that evil
may be overcome with good.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3><a id="IRON"></a>XXXIX.&mdash;OLD IRONSIDES.</h3>

<p>1. When war was declared between the United
States and Great Britain in 1812, the British
power was dominant upon the ocean. Since the
times of Sir Francis Drake and the Spanish Armada,
the British navy had retained the supremacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
then gained. In three hundred years no British
fleet had ever surrendered to an enemy. Such
continued success made the British arrogant, and
they looked down with contempt upon the naval
power of any other people. At the beginning of
the war, the American navy was small and weak.
It consisted of about twenty vessels, the largest
of which were frigates.</p>

<p>2. But the few vessels of the American navy
were strongly built, and were manned by officers
who had gained their fighting experience in the
war with the Barbary states. Neither the officers
nor men were in any fear of the great power of
Britain, and they particularly hated the British
for their habit of impressing American seamen.
Thus it happened that all the American commanders
had made up their minds to fight whenever
the force against them was any where nearly equal,
and to fight for victory.</p>

<p>3. Among the vessels of our little navy was
the frigate Constitution, better known, from the
strength of her build, as "Old Ironsides." At
the breaking out of the war she was commanded
by Captain Isaac Hull, one of our most experienced
naval officers. In August, 1812, Hull
sailed on a cruise, looking for an enemy, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
short time he fell in with the British frigate Guerriere,
a vessel about equal in size to the Constitution.
Both parties advanced eagerly to the conflict,
but in thirty minutes the Guerriere was reduced
to a mere wreck, and the British flag was
hauled down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus141.jpg" width="500" height="424" alt="old ironsides" />
</div>

<p>4. Captain Hull sailed into Boston Harbor,
where the Old Ironsides was repaired and made
ready for sea. Captain Hull generously resigned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
so as to permit others to have a share of glory, and
Captain Bainbridge was appointed to the command
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>5. On December 29th, Captain Bainbridge,
while cruising off the coast of Brazil, encountered
the British frigate Java, one of the best-appointed
ships in the British navy. A running battle ensued,
which lasted four hours, and so well did
Captain Bainbridge manage his ship that he reduced
the Java to a wreck, while the damage to
the Constitution was so slight that it was ready
for another fight the next day.</p>

<p>6. Peace between the two countries was arranged
at Ghent, between commissioners appointed
by both powers, in December, 1814, but the news
was not received in this country for several weeks.
The Constitution, under the command of Captain
Stewart, sailed from Boston on a cruise in December,
and, on the 20th of February, 1815, she encountered
two British vessels&mdash;the Cyane and Levant&mdash;the
combined force of which was equal to
that of the Constitution, if not greater. The action
commenced at six in the evening, and continued
for four hours in the moonlight night. At
ten o'clock, both British vessels were prizes to the
Constitution, while she was so little damaged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
complete repairs were made without making a
port.</p>

<p>7. After the war great improvements were made
in ship-building, and soon the old frigate became
too old-fashioned for active service at sea, and for
a time she was employed as a receiving-ship. At
last it was proposed to withdraw her entirely from
service, and break her up. This proposition roused
the indignation of the poet Holmes, then a boy,
and his hot wrath broke up the project and saved
the ship. She is now used as a school-ship for the
training of seamen. Here follows the poem:</p>

<h3><a id="CHICAGO"></a>XL.&mdash;CHICAGO.</h3>

<p>1. It is the evening of October 9, 1871. The
great city of the West is settling down into the
quiet of the night. The Sabbath has ended. The
churches have closed, and citizens of all ranks and
kinds are peacefully resting in their homes. The
guardians of the night are all out, faithful to watch,
quick to detect, and prompt to act. Three hundred
thousand people throw off the cares of the
day, and seek their needed repose. No cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
alarm, save the wind, which since noon has risen
from a gentle breeze to a fierce gale at sunset.
Even now it increases, and in the morning papers
we may expect a catalogue of chimneys blown
down, and of houses unroofed. Beyond this there
is nothing to fear, and all is well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus145.jpg" width="500" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption">View of Chicago from Madison Street Bridge, before the Fire.</div>
</div>

<p>2. A little way out from what is now the heart
of the town was a section covered with piles of
lumber and rows of wooden tenements ready for
the torch. The lights are flickering through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
dark alleys as a poor woman takes a lamp and
goes into a hovel to milk the cow. The blustering
wind bids her be careful. An uneasy movement
of the cow, and the lamp is overturned into
the straw and litter of the stable. A flame shoots
up, and the milker has scarcely time to reach the
door when the whole building is on fire. She,
with her children, rush into the street, as the
flame comes in through roof, window, and doorway
of her dwelling. Then the roar of the wind-swept
flame and the appalling cry of fire!</p>

<p>3. But the city is prepared for these accidents.
The fire-bells ring out their alarm. Trained horses
take their places by the steam fire-engines, and the
heart has scarcely time to beat before they are on
a mad gallop down the streets. In a moment a
thousand jets of water will subdue the fire, and
the city will again sink to quiet rest.</p>

<p>4. But, swift as the firemen speed to the scene,
the flame is swifter still. Borne on the wings of
the wind, it leaps from street to street. It is no
longer a wind but a tempest, and a tempest of
flame. The track of the devouring element broadens
and dives toward the heart of the city. Men,
women, and children rush frantically to get out of
the path of destruction. Down go miles of stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
houses and blocks of business. The reservoirs of
grain, the vast hotels, and the spires of churches
appear for a moment through the glare, then melt
away into ashes. The whole world is in flames!</p>

<p>5. While hope remains, men are active; but
now they stand in sullen despair. They look on
helpless and hopeless through the long hours of
the night. The first rays of the morning reveal a
scene of widespread and total desolation. The
heart of the city has been consumed. Twenty
thousand of its inhabitants are homeless.</p>

<p>6. One consoling thought is left. The fire-fiend
is at last curbed, hemmed in on the east by
the lake, on the north by the river which stretches
between it and the homes in which seventy-five
thousand people are peacefully asleep, all unaware
of the devastation that has been raging so near
them. Surely the fiery foe will not reach those
homes. The river is their protection. The comforting
thought is but momentary. Already a
livid cloud is sweeping across the narrow stream.
Burning brands and glowing embers are borne on
the wings of a fierce tornado straight toward those
peaceful homes.</p>

<p>7. The scene that ensues has no parallel in the
history of the world. Who shall arouse those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sleepers and warn them of their peril? Who, now,
when the flames are already at the doors, shall
bear away the sick ones, the aged, the little children,
the babes, to safety? Alas! whither shall
they be borne? The lake on one side; on the
other, a narrow pathway leading toward the country
to the north, along which the flames are rushing
with mad rapidity. Every other way of escape
is cut off.</p>

<p>8. Many plunge breast-deep into the lake, and
there during long hours stand many hundreds of
people, feeble women, some with babes in their
arms, many sick and aged, till the fire subsides and
rescue comes. Nearly one hundred thousand souls
are fleeing before the merciless flames. During that
fearful Monday this great throng continue their
flight without food, without water, scorched by
the hot blast, their clothes and often their hair on
fire; the stronger bearing the weaker in their arms
and on their shoulders, they rush on, every moment
pursued by the flames. Many sink to the
ground to rise no more, how many never will be
known.</p>

<p>9. Finally they are in the open country. It is
a strange, weird place to pass a night in, a graveyard,
but it is a place of safety from the foe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
all day had pursued them. And there, about ten
o'clock at night, as they see the last house on
the other side of the city limits crumble to ashes,
they sink down to their dismal bivouac, many
pillowing their heads upon the graves among
which they lay.</p>

<p>10. Many were the "heroic deeds" that had
been wrought on that fearful day, heroic deeds of
husbands and wives in rescuing each other and
their children, of children in rescuing parents and
brothers and sisters, of many in helping the helpless
when sore pressed themselves, and of all in
maintaining the brave, heroic fight against such
fearful odds.</p>

<p>11. And now opens another chapter of the
"story of heroic deeds" in the history of the Chicago
fire. It is the story of the heroism of sympathy,
of charity, of generosity, of dauntless energy.
How shall these thousands of homeless ones,
with winter impending, be sheltered? How food
gotten to the famished crowd in the graveyard,
who have not tasted food since Sunday night?</p>

<p>12. The city stricken is still quick to act. During
Monday, while the conflagration is still raging,
relief committees are organizing; the houses of
those who are left with houses are being opened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
those who have none; the sound of axe and hammer
is heard on every side, erecting barracks and
temporary cabins; men and women are gathering
stores of food and clothing; and loaded wagons
are making their way around the burning city to
reach the encampment in the cemetery and on the
open prairie. The telegraph has also been set to
telling to other cities the story of the great calamity.
Before and during the night trains of
cars come from the whole country for many miles
around, loaded with food, clothing, blankets, and
even delicacies for the sick. And so on to
Tuesday morning the half-famished, homeless
multitude once more welcome their morning meal,
and before night the whole vast multitude on the
streets have obtained some kind of shelter.</p>

<p>13. And now the return click is heard at the
telegraph-offices. Cities too distant to send food
send words of cheer and money. As the day wears
on, the wires can scarcely carry all the messages of
sympathy which come pouring in. London, Paris,
Berlin, all the great cities of Europe, vie with each
other in liberality, and send their substantial offerings
through the cable under the sea, and, before
the sun sets, messages of organized aid come from
distant Calcutta and Melbourne. The thrill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
human sympathy had encircled the earth. Nor
did the supplies fail until the people of the grateful
city cried, "Enough!"</p>

<p>14. In the old Arabian story, the palace of
Aladdin is built in a single night by the aid of
magic. But now the wonder wrought by the
genii is surpassed. From the ashes of that terrible
night a new city grows up, marvelous in its
freshness, its strength, and its beauty. No need
of magic here, or rather the only magic needed
is that of self-reliance and the sympathy of the
world so bountifully expressed.</p>

<p>15. With a full heart the poet Whittier describes
the scene, and the lesson to be derived
from it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i3">Men said at vespers, "All is well!"</div>
<div class="verse i3">In one wild night the city fell;</div>
<div class="verse i3">Fell shrines of prayer and marts of gain,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Before the fiery hurricane.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i4">16. On threescore spires had sunset shone,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Where ghastly sunrise looked on none.</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<div class="verse i3">The fiends of fire from street to street,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Turned powerless to the blinding glare,</div>
<div class="verse i3">The dumb defiance of despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i4">18. A sudden impulse thrilled each wire</div>
<div class="verse i3">That signaled round that sea of fire;</div>
<div class="verse i3">Swift words of cheer, warm heart-throbs came,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i4">19. From East, from West, from South, from North,</div>
<div class="verse i3">The messages of hope shot forth,</div>
<div class="verse i3">And underneath the severing wave,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i4">20. Fair seemed the old; but fairer still</div>
<div class="verse i3">The new, the dreary void shall fill</div>

</div>

<p>This new Grammar is designed for advanced students who desire
to extend their studies in English beyond the course ordinarily pursued
in Common or Grammar Schools. In this work, grammar is treated as
a science based on <i>facts and principles</i> derived from the actual use of
the language and not from technical rules and traditions.</p>

<p>Its aim is to lead the pupil to deduce for himself grammatical rules
from the best examples of construction and style to be found in English
literature and to acquire skill in their use. For this purpose abundant
and apposite quotations from standard authors are given to illustrate
each grammatical relation and construction and to show the student that
he is dealing with the <em>facts</em> of the language and not with the <em>theories</em> of
the grammarians.</p>

<p>While the book represents original and advanced methods it is at
the same time conservative in treatment, and aims to preserve what is
good in the older methods.</p>
